I haven't personally played with them, but I understand they position themselves as a wannabe-collegiate team. That being said, I'd ask them if they perhaps have a beginners' group. 
Other that that, the two courts on summerhill (by the football field) usually attract a lot of people playing recreationally when it gets warm outside. I'm sure you can find some people to join-in with if you come by at a busy hour. I go there every once in a while by myself just to practise some serves, and occasionally someone asks to get on the court with me; or I see someone practising by themselves and I join them. You can try the same.
Do ask at the ARC whether they rent out the rackets. Last summer they did not due to covid, but that will hopefully change. If not, canadian tire used to sell el-cheapo rackets for something like $40. If you later get properly into tennis, then the Raquet Science on Barrie st. can be a great one-stop shop for all your tennis needs. Larry there is a great guy, and he's always been more than helpful. Come to think of it, he must know most if not all regulars in town, so he might be a good person to ask if you'll be in search for a partner or a group.

I suggest you find someone good at tennis to play with the first few times, to give you a general sense of what to do and how to do it. From there, you can find a like-minded newbie and play and learn together.

And i don't know if there is any ARC tennis lessons, but there should be. 😄

In terms of if it’s a good fit, I personally think queens commerce seems like a way better program and experience than Ivey simply because you do not have to worry about staying in the program nearly as much. and you don’t spend 2 years learning about something random only to then drop that and cram the whole business degree into the next 2 years. However if u want to be a tech pm then maybe studying eng or CS in those first 2 years would be a good option for you.",2022-02-18,,1.0,False

I plan on pursuing either consulting or Tech PM ( or even IB) Is queens a good fit for those careers? compared to Ivey.
I am also an international student ( South Asian) and I heard queens is pretty racist especially commerce. I even saw a post where it was mentioned Commerce students look down on public school kids (although i didn't attend one) and people who work part time. Is this true? 
I heard the exclusive commerce clubs only take people with prior connections (parents in banking,etc). Now since the clubs are pretty important for landing consulting and IB in the US. Do you think it will be a good decision for me to go to queens if my parents aren't in banking and finance or work in Canada?",2022-02-18,False,0.3,svsu8b,"Hey!
I’m a first year international(indian) student in Qcomm. 
1) queens and Ivey both are great for IB or consulting. you can do a dual degree at both unis. Queens is business focused from. Day 1 whereas ivey is general for 2 years.

2) from batch of 24 onwards, there has been an increase in diversity. I’ve had one racist incident but that wasn’t related to commerce people. Commies are actually friendly! No one really cares about how you look like and other stuff.

3) I’ve never actually witnessed any discrimination related to public/private schools. I went to a private school myself but Idet that matters much.

4) clubs are getting more diverse year after year, a lot of co-chairs are Asian and other POCs. The process of getting into clubs like quic and limestone is hard and rigorous

However, with that being said, if you’re looking for a more friendly culture and more of a “typical” uni experience, I would HIGHLY recommend Queens over UofT. The environment at UofT, speaking from experience, is very isolating, toxic and competitive compared to Queens.

Thank you :)",2022-02-15,False,0.77,st2hgf,"I did my undergrad in psychology so keep that in mind as a caveat when you read this. I understand that it is a completely different landscape from biochemistry but I think some of these comments might still be relevant. 

First, try not to be too rigid about your research interests. It's way too early in the game to be too narrow in what you want to do. I knew I was really interested in autism but there are only so many people in one university researching that area so I kept it very broad. I knew I was interested in youth and their families so those were the labs I would apply to even though the topic wasn't specifically what I wanted to study. At your stage in the game, you're really trying to just get your foot in the door and build your CV. I've worked in several different labs and I think that is a big strength for me - I learned about the research I like/dislike, how to work with different people, different research methods, etc. 

I'm not sure if you looked for research opportunities outside of universities but that might be worth checking out. For example, in psychology, there's a lot of research that gets done in hospitals, and those people are not necessarily affiliated with a university. I imagine this is very likely true for molecular biology and genomics as well. 

Secondly, the pandemic is really impacting research opportunities whether we like it or not. There are A LOT of restrictions around whether people can come into volunteer and it really does limit things. Knowing that some people are working from home, I tried contacting professors from other provinces asking about remote opportunities. Again, psychology is really different but I was able to get volunteer work in a completely different province. The supervisor ended up writing me a very strong reference letter and allowed me to put my name on a conference poster even though we never met in person. You wouldn't get hands-on experience but you might be able to work on a lit review or a meta-analysis, and attending lab meetings virtually can be helpful for building connections. I emailed about \~30 people outside of my province and 3 responded back with opportunities so it is possible to find something, at least in psychology. 

However, the real reality here is that it is oftentimes hard to get research positions, especially at this time of year. I think July, August, and September tend to be better months for getting a research position. Current lab members may be going to graduate school and would be leaving the lab around that time so the labs would likely be looking for new people.

Don't be offended or worried if people don't respond to your emails. I probably send out \~70 emails over several months after my undergrad trying to find research opportunities. As a general tip, I would try to keep your emails short and concise and include your CV and transcript in the initial email. Good luck! :)",2022-02-16,,2.0,False

Queens has entrance bursaries and scholarships you can apply for - I would say you have a very good shot of getting a bursary. You can apply each year after first year for a general undergraduate bursary too. 

I think it would be worth reaching out to the Financial aid/ Awards office for advice on funding options available to you specifically. They may be able to tell you what OSAP would need for you to be funded as independent.

Finally, if money gets tight for a little bit, Queens has a food bank service available to students.

Finding money in your budget:

Can I ask you to elaborate on your living expenses a bit? $1500 per month seems high to me. In my undergrad (2016-2020), living off campus (in Ottawa) I paid $750 rent including utilities and furnishings, $200 in groceries (including $50 in takeout), $50 phone plan per month ($1000 per month minimum). I spent about $100 per term on a few new/gently used items of clothing but otherwise tried to find free entertainment. Maybe $50 in personal items/ toiletries per term. Tuition included a bus pass at that point so I didn't have a car. I would try to scale back your living expenses if you can.
 
If you're comfortable living with lots of people, look at student co-ops for housing. You save on rent and groceries in return for doing chores, cooking, etc. once or twice each week. And I would imagine it's a great way to meet people.

Last thing, try to work as much as you can during the summer leading up to when you start university. That will help you have a good emergency fund during the school year.",2022-02-15,,15.0,False

You may say get a part time job which is not a bad suggestion, but I am going to be taking computer science and teaching myself to code.  I'm not confident I can get good marks, learn the material, teach myself to code and do side projects and balance a work study and part time job all at the same time.  One has to go and If I have the choice I'd rather try to enjoy my time at Queens instead of stressing 24/7.

The networking opportunities for Computing will likely be similar at other schools seeing as our department is quite small. If you want to supplement this, join as many clubs/events as possible.

With Covid-19, most people's social life has become greatly reduced, so it's likely going to be the same wherever you go. 

While Queen's still has a decent reputation, the Computing department is not very good. Our CO-OP program is subpar and some of the classes are somewhat outdated. I've had some very poor profs in my time but thankfully some have retired and the new ones seem a bit better. On top of that, a lot of tech companies do not care about your school's reputation, with the new trend of tech workers avoiding higher education all together (I'd still advise attending to get good fundamentals and to take advantage of internships).

They have addiction issues and arent supporting me at the moment, I live in a residence for homeless youth and have OW to pay for my room and board.  I do not have paperwork to back this up to osap to make me independent.  I've qualified according to the osap estimator for around 10500 in grants and 5000 in loans, mix this with the federal student loans I am eligible for of 11900 that makes 27400, most of which will be loans and doesnt really leave me anything breathing room after my living costs and tuition are paid.  Tuition and books is 9500 and I estimate my living cost at 1500 per month, plus my tuition equals 27500, so I am literally barely scraping by.  Supplement that with a work study that only gives me 1000 per term Its not looking too good.

&#x200B;

You may say get a part time job which is not a bad suggestion, but I am going to be taking computer science and teaching myself to code.  I'm not confident I can get good marks, learn the material, teach myself to code and do side projects and balance a work study and part time job all at the same time.  One has to go and If I have the choice I'd rather try to enjoy my time at Queens instead of stressing 24/7.

So tl;dr How can I attend Queens without going into a massive amount of debt and still have time to devote to my studies and side projects for computer science.  Thanks, sorry if this is a little ranty and all over the place I'm very nervous

>	All students, staff, faculty, and visitors are required to wear an ASTM F2100 Level 2 medical-grade mask indoors on campus. Students attending in-person activities and employees who are working on-campus are eligible to receive ASTM F2100 Level 2 medical-grade masks from the university. Masks for students will be distributed over a two-week period beginning Monday, February 21 through Friday, March 11. Information regarding distribution locations and times will be communicated by faculties and schools in the near future. The university will also provide departments/units with ASTM F2100 Level 2 Medical Masks to be distributed to employees working on-campus.

Additionally, KN95 masks do not undergo the same vigorous and standardised level of testing as NIOSH-approved N95 masks and are not allowed in many workplaces.

I’m hoping this doesn’t sound dismissive, but I’m trying to say I get it. 

As hard as it is, your parents are right that you should try to finish out the year. We’re halfway through this semester. Just take things one day at a time.

In the summer, you’ll have time to think things over and try out a few things. Whatever you end up doing, I recommend finding something to volunteer for a few hours a week. Something you’re passionate about, has absolutely nothing to do with school or future work plans, and something where you get to spend time with people who aren’t related to the university at all. A soup kitchen, animal shelter, church program… it doesn’t matter as long as you love the work and feel like you’re making a difference.

Here’s why: in school it is easy to get trapped in a bubble. All your friends are students, who are stressed in the same ways, have the same interests, come from similar backgrounds. Even your parents, siblings, cousins and other family are probably similar. It’s easy to get caught up in that pressure. Same goes for a paid job. Most jobs students get are jobs where there are lots of other students. They might be motivated by a need to pad their resume, or needing cash, but they will still be caught up in the stress.

But volunteering, if it’s something you’re really interested in and not something to add as a resume line, will do wonderful things for your perspective. You’ll meet people who are 20, 40 maybe even 60 years older than you, who have seen life. Some of them not only didn’t go to university, but never even wanted to. And they still lead awesome lives that are interesting and fulfilling. You’ll start to plan your week around your Monday night you work at the soup kitchen, or the Thursday where you play piano at the long term care home.

When it comes time to make a decision, you’ll have a new perspective. Hopefully you’ll have a few new friends. And whether you drop out, switch majors, switch schools, go part time, or come back to campus with a new passion for what you’re doing, you’ll know.",2022-02-12,,41.0,False

222,Research Study on Overconfidence in Current Issues,0,sqdcry,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/sqdcry/research_study_on_overconfidence_in_current_issues/,4,Opportunity," Hi everyone!

I am a student from University of Toronto Mississauga who is currently working on her Undergraduate Honours Thesis in Psychology, supervised by Professor Stuart Kamenetsky from the Department of Psychology.

We are currently conducting a study that examines whether overconfidence in knowledge about current issues university students face is predictive of adjustment and well-being and prosocial behaviour above and beyond demographic and dispositional factors. Our study will investigate whether social media usage amongst university students can contribute to overconfidence in knowledge about controversial current issues and whether this can impact well-being and adjustment and prosocial behaviours in university students. The current issues that are investigated include: the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies, physical and mental health and well-being, risky behaviour, disability, climate change, indigenous issues, race issues, sexual orientation and gender diversity. The study has been approved by the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) Ethics Review Committee (Reference #: 2021-13) to ensure that there is no deception involved and this study involves only minimal risk to participants.

We are looking for undergraduate students who are currently studying in a Canadian university to complete an online survey consisting of a total of 10 questionnaires. The entire survey should take a total of 1.5 hours to complete.

The results of this study will contribute to existing research on cognitive biases in Psychology and may provide insights about the role that polarized views on current controversial issues may play in students’ adjustment and well-being. All responses will be kept confidential and strictly anonymous as we are only interested in general trends in overconfidence. Any personal information obtained from the participant will be deleted after the study.

The link to the survey is provided below:

BCHM 218, if not a core course for you, is probably the highest-value credit you can take for the Bio/Biochem section. I don't think taking any PSYC or SOCY credits is necessary, as the MCAT mainly tests definitions/discrete knowledge in these subjects and is overall quite lax. For CARS, make reading anything you'll engage with a new hobby. Try to follow the plot and deeper meaning of novels, historical pieces, philosophy, etc.

If not, remember that Con Ed is its own separate degree and it does not impact your major's GPA. Some people fail PRAC even if they do attend and just try again next year. That's why 4th year doesn't have PROFF or PRAC incase something like this happens.

Absolutely terrible. Whatever you heard, it's probably worse. For example they don't even serve you real eggs in the morning. Did you know that the buffet style eggs are actually liquid eggs that come in a bag like bagged milk that they cook in a steamer to make 'omlettes'? Breakfast sausages are also terrible salt packed grease packages. Only edible breakfast item is stale cereal or the cubed fried potatoes (which are actually quite decent). Sidenote the Almond milk is usually better then the other milks but that might just be my preference. 

Also for TAM non cafe restaurants (TAM is trade a meal that lets you trade one of your meal plan meals (which you have a limited amount per day/week I might add) for a specified menu item at a campus food stall) some of them are meh-ok. Location 21 is pretty good, they serve actual eggs there, but some like Khao which tries to serve some sort of Americanized Asian cuisine fails utterly at it. Though the pizza pizza and booster juice are decent TAMs. I might add your TAMS are also limited in #.

Cafe food: 4/10 

TAM: 5-8 depends on location

Cafe Breakfast: 1/10 (I honestly recommend just swiping some fruit when you go to the cafe for dinner and have it for breakfast the next morning. That way you can also spend your a TAM on booster juice or something).


>2. Which res dining hall is best/worst

Depends what their serving that day. Some days have specialized theme nights which can be hit or miss. Though in my opinion I think the West Campus Cafe is the worst and Leonard hall one the best (it's just the cleanest and biggest also usually has shorter or faster lines).

>3. Where is best for food outside of the dining halls

Go to downtown Kingston Princess Street. It's a short bus ride, or bike ride (though I don't recommend biking there cuz it'll ~50/50 get stolen.) Some restaurants can be a bit on the pricey side (that's what happens when you have no competition) but some are great. I really like most of the bubble tea shops.

>4. Any other great spots outside of the meal plan that you recommend

If you want to experience authentic Chinese cuisine tryout Silver Wok. Especially great if you have a friend that can speak Mandarin for the secret menu. Oh that reminds me: NEVER. I repeat **NEVER** go to Dim Sum Kingston. Place is overpriced and absolutely horrible.

A great Korean restaurant is Gangnam style. It's in a decent price range and is also really good. 

Definitely worth exploring the restaurant (and bar culture if your old enough) of downtown

>5. Any other comments for new student

Get a microwave and a kettle. Technically you're not 'allowed' a microwave, but technically you're also not allowed a kettle which 99% of students in res will have one. Just with the microwave make sure you have nothing else running else you'll blow the breaker. I blew it on multiple occasions once with 10 minute intervals. That was an awkward conversation to have with the front desk. 

Also a hotplate is worth considering. Most common rooms have a stove and oven but nothing beats cooking in your dorm room. Especially late at night (or early morning depending on your perspective) after a party chilling in your room with some mates as you fry up some omletes with extra buttery toast. 

If you have any questions lmk

Edit: I'm seeing alot of people use arbitrary scales to judge so I'm going to try and ground my scale with a comparative reference. So a 1/10 for me is something like Mr. Noodle ramen that you can make with a packet, a bowl, and hot water. It's just calories to sustain your existence. 5/10 would be a frozen udon style soup. Using a powdered broth and soup base with some basic additions like a fried egg, some soy sauce and sesame oil. A 10/10 would be something like hand kneaded and cut ramen noodles, in a slow cooked porkbone broth with hard-boiled eggs still runny on the inside soaked in a sweet soy sauce mixture overnight, and topped off with a tender, slowly braised sliced pork belly. 

Alternatively we could look at it as sandwiches. At 1/10 you got your cheese sandwich. It's not even grilled, just a slice of cheese between two pieces of bread. Again just calories for subsistence. 4-6/10 at the lower end of that scale you have something like a well crafted PB and J. It's nothing fancy but it gets the job done. 6/10 you have a decent grilled cheese with the bread pre sauted with butter to crispy in a skillet then toasted with something like an aged orange cheddar with perhaps a small slice of gruyere, or soft goat cheese in the middle. 10/10 we're talking Brioche bun, or fresh sourdough from this morning, cut and sauted in a skillet with some low salt butter. Bacon lightly fried in avacado oil, then in the microwave to finish it off and crisp. A fried egg, sliced avacado, sun dried tomato, and a slice of goat cheese with a dash a Dijon mustard on the bread.

I'd say it depends on the day, I'm vegetarian so I'd give it a 5 or 6 but for most people I feel like it'd be a bit higher because there's more variety. The retail places (Loco, lazy) are actually pretty good in my opinion, I'd say an 8.
2. Ban Righ is probably the highest quality, but Lenny often has more options (pizza all the time). Both are safe bets and have mostly the same stuff at any time so it doesn't matter too much.
3. The on campus non dining hall food is pretty good, you can get decent meals from lazy, loco, pita pit, cogro, etc. There's also Tims and Starbucks for quick things
4. Honestly no <3 Going out to eat is pretty expensive so I don't do it very often
5. Try to look at the menu (you can find it online) before going to the dining hall so you know what your options are in advance! I do this a lot, and if there isn't much I can eat I use a TAM.",2022-02-09,,1.0,False

Check the menus online before you go, after a while you'll know which meals you prefer and can choose the days you'd rather get a TAM (like fast food on campus for a meal swipe). 
2. I can only speak for main campus, but Ban is usually better and the staff are a lot nicer imo. Plus it's smaller so not as busy as Lenny can get. However, Ban is only open for weekdays and Lenny has a pizza bar. 
3. I'm assuming you're asking for TAM/on campus locations. It kinda depends on what you're going for. I prefer Loco for the burgers and breakfast, plus they have a salad bar, but Lazy's chicken options are way better and they also have smoothies, subs, and a Mexican station. Lazy also has a really cool lounge vibe. For coffee, pastries, and bagels, Cogro is the go to. 
4. Tommy's has a really great vintage diner vibe and they always play really great music. Sophie's Noodle House has great noodles and dumplings, plus they're relatively affordable if you're on a budget. Crave has good coffee and pastries, same with Kingston Coffe House. 
5. Utilize the lakefront the first few months before it gets really cold. Eat there, study there, go swimming at the pier. You'll wish you did it more when late november weather hits.

5. Any other comments for new student",2022-02-09,False,0.9,so2zw8,"1/2: Very much depends on the station you get it from and the dining hall. Ive only been to leonard and ban righ, but here are my thoughts:  
Ban righ has better pasta always, typically has either healthier or better tasting food on average, and is a smaller service area. Unfortunately no pizza station and a few others are missing as well.

Leonard has more variety, and its stations vary in quality a lot more. The pasta almost always sucks, the additional dishes are hit or miss, the grill is mostly good but lacks on toppings sometimes (you can take toppings from the sandwich station), the stir fry is almost always great, the pizza is a good baseline, and of course the sandwich and salad stations are there as just consistent food if you don't want anything else that day.  


3: in the meal plan, if you are in residence than location 21 and lazy scholar are average, but the chicken caesar wraps are pretty good. Their main benefit is that they are open until 1 AM. I've heard good things about the mackintosh-cory places but never been.  


4: Can't help you much here, haven't tried any places regularly.  


5: TAMS are your friend, but try not to use more than 1 a day. you have roughly enough for 5 every 6 days or 1 a day depending on if you go home for winter break or not. Flex dollars can be used to buy milk and snacks from location 21, but the selection is limited.",2022-02-09,,1.0,False

I took the course back in the Fall 2021 semester with Frau Holzschuh, and let me tell you, it was an absolutely fantastic experience for me! 

The class itself is not too difficult. I would study for quizzes as well as the exam the night before and finished with an A+, though I did attend all lectures and I am relatively good at picking up new languages. The prof herself was amazing, I honestly miss the class a lot! I definitely would have taken GRMN 102 if it fit with my schedule this term.

As for your other questions — we were in the Law Building last term, and we had two 1.5 hour long lectures a week. I’m assuming the 3 hour lecture is once a week? 3 hour lectures are incredibly long, but it really is an awesome class, so I would stick with it (especially if you love language learning).

I took ANAT 100 last semester. The lab practicals are much more challenging than the block theory evals, in my opinion. Although they're not proctored, you have to identify certain parts on the body and sometimes it's very specific and unclear what part it is. 

I suggest really looking over the structure of anatomical parts because they will give you an image and point to something small, and you have to identify it. I also found the time went by super quick so make sure to not spend too much time on one question - if you can't figure it out, move on to the next. 

The lab practicals are done through Wiley Plus. There are great tools for studying through Wiley as well, they have cadaver images where you can practice pin pointing anatomical parts.

Differences between UoW, QU and OttawaU:

UoW is generally considered the academically strongest of the three. OttawaU and QU are *roughly* equal, but Queens is probably better. 

Social life at UoW is generally non-existant. Especially with COVID. Literally had two friends leave UoW to come to Queens because there was literally no socialization. Queens is a party school. Ottawa not so much. 

Quality as a tourist? Well... UoW is in the middle of fucking no where close to toronto. Queens has some historic stuff and some niche interesting things, and is roughly equidistant to the three most major cities in Canada. But unless you've got a car you're not going anywhere any time soon. OttawaU is inside Ottawa so you'd have the most 'Tourist-y' experience there. 

Not sure what you mean wit your city/location thing. Ask again

> experiences 

Everyone's different mate. Personally I think Queens is a fine school. Its got some good social life, but you've got to seriously push for it. because most people are just stuck in their laptop if they're not home. If you don't you don't try, you don't get invited to parties.

Waterloo is one of the best schools in Canada for math, science and engineering. This is due in large part to its well-established co-op program, which you would (presumably) not have access to as an exchange student. The Waterloo area also is a really big tech hub, with lots of startups hiring Waterloo grads. The student experience there is awful though. I have a friend who goes there and he's told me that a good chunk of the student population never leaves their rooms. As an exchange student I'd imagine this isn't what you're looking for unless you are very keen on making connections with professors for research opportunities or with companies in the nearby area for internship/job opportunities.

Queen's and UOttawa would both be solid choices imo. Ottawa is obviously a much bigger city than Kingston, with all of the amenities/attractions that you'd expect out of a capital city. Ottawa also has a very outdoor culture, with some pretty amazing parks in the area for hiking in the summer and cross-country skiing in the winter. Both Kingston and Ottawa are really nice in the fall. Kingston has much more of a ""university town"" feel to it (population of Kingston is about 130k, Queen's alone has 25k students). Almost all of the student housing is 10-15 minutes away from campus, so there's no worry about getting stuck somewhere out of the way and having to commute into school every day. I don't know too much about incoming exchange here, but I believe there are some student houses that are dedicated to foreign students so you shouldn't have an issue meeting people/getting invited to parties if you're reasonably social and that's your thing.

Also, you don't need a car to get to Toronto/Montreal from Kingston (or Ottawa or Waterloo for that matter). Via Rail runs cheap trains throughout all of Southern Ontario (just make sure you book in advance or else the prices can get steep).

3) why you got it right (did you know it or did you guess?) or wrong (did you read the question properly?)
Then review all of the possible answer choices if it was a multiple choice question. Think about why each of them are wrong and how they could be made right. If you’re doing all the assigned stuff and practise it may be an issue with test taking strategy too.

Speaking from a white, straight passing (ig that's what i could call it?) person, I really can't speak from the point of view of others, and I could have quite the naive approach, but I thought I'd share my perspective anyways.

I'm also in health sci first year. Let me say that it is an AMAZING program. Covid has kind if screwed all of us, but the progam is so interesting and inspiring. It's also very prestigious. The first few months when we had classes IRL i've never met more well-rounded, unique and respectful people of all different races. I personally don't really define someone by their race, but looking back I found my program pretty diverse. I was bullied as a kid, went to highschool with a bunch of assholes, never had that many friends besides a few close ones and my bf, and extremely anti social, but Queen's seemed like the most welcoming environment, something I genuinely haven't experienced before. Everyone was so nice and I've made so many good friends!! Obviously there was a few that I'm like hmmmm probably won't hang out with them again, but mostly all very good people if you try to surround yourself with like-minded people.

I can't speak for everyone, I've never experienced hate completely based off of my race/sexuality, and I'm not here to invalidate anyone with negative experiences. Health sci is an amazing program and the fact that you got in is very impressive! I've never experienced a better environment and I'm so glad I chose queens:)

I’ve noticed that the perspectives of queer ppl & poc are stated in the comments, and I largely agree with them.

**Who am I? The Experience of Identity Change of Chinese Independent Migrants in Canada**

Hello everyone! My name is Alysha Chan Kent and I am a PhD Candidate in Counselling Psychology at the University of Calgary, working under the supervision of Dr. Sharon Robertson. I am currently recruiting participants for my doctoral dissertation project. This project has received ethics approval by the University of Calgary's Research Ethics Board.

I am looking for participants, currently between the ages of 20-29, who independently migrated to Canada between the ages of 13-17 from China or other countries or regions where the dominant culture is Chinese (e.g., Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan). The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of Chinese independent migrants in Canada, with the primary aim of examining the influence of this experience on one's changing sense of identity. Minors who independently migrate to a new country unaccompanied by their parents are sometimes termed in the academic literature as ""parachute kids."" This research will inform counselling, social service, and educational practices related to supporting independent migrants.

As a token of appreciation, participants will receive a $25 gift card. I would like to thank you in advance for your time and consideration!

What are the houses like?  Are they very noisy?  Is there a lot of sound transfer between the rooms?  What are the meals like?  How easy it to pick your volunteer hours?  Any info you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,2022-02-03,False,0.99,sjs6kv,"The houses are pretty good but you definitely have to get used to sharing a space with A LOT of roommates. My house has 9 people which seems like a lot but I haven't had too many issues sharing our 3 bathrooms. The one area I really struggle with is living in such a mess all the time. Houses are supposed to follow a cleaning schedule, but that never really happens. Food is okay. If you're a picky eater then I would opt-out of the full meal plan because you don't really get a selection. It's a good way to make friends though and you truly get the full uni experience of everyone learning how to live on their own for the first time! And if anything it teaches you the value of getting your degree and getting a high-paying job so you never have to live with roommates again lol. Although I complain about the co-op a lot, I still signed up to live there next semester as well just because of the convenience and the cheap prices! Volunteer hours are simple, you just tell them the hours that you can't work and they'll just fit you into the schedule (tip: say you're busy all fridays, weekends, and monday mornings - nothing worse than cooking eggs when you're violently hungover)",2022-02-06,,1.0,False

I didn't think I could do it, but I was happily proven wrong - I was accepted to the Queen's Education program! I'll be there in May!

First I'll be finishing a human rights program at Carleton, and then very quickly moving to Kingston and starting classes after exams. My question for all of you? What should I know about Queen's/the program/Kingston before I arrive? Any tips for a newcomer?

I’ll give you a heads up that second year chem is a huge jump from CHEM 112. That’s because you’re learning a bunch of new content that was either not taught at all or lightly covered in first year. You also have labs for each class (aside from CHEM 222) so that adds on to the coursework. Third year is alright, the lab reports for the full year lab course you have to take can be time consuming, but it’s doable. Fourth year you have another full year lab that you do on your own under the supervision of a professor, which helps with preparing you for grad school and other things. It’s a great way to strengthen your independent research skills and lab work too.

The lab reports are marked harder because there are higher expectations than with first year labs, but over time, you’ll start to get the hang of it.

There will be on call nights that are busier but you plan around that. The nice thing about being on call is it forces you to stay in/near residence, which can increase your ability to do homework. We also could ""double dip"" in terms of hosting a rez event while on call. i would do a 'mugs night' for the floor when I was on call. my husband would plan events around TV/sports events- students would watch these anyways, so he turned into an event. 

It can be more work if you're on call with dons who don't take it seriously- I was in Vic and each on call you'd be in charge of 2 floors (so 1/2, 3/4, 5/6), but if a Don didn't respond to their pages, then the front desk would page another don to respond. One of the other dons would always sign in his pager and then leave, so we'd end up getting paged to his floor. But the RLC was great at responding to those types of issues.

I don't know if its still the same- but we got free room, I had a super single, and a free meal plan, which was good financially. You just need to learn to plan around the busy- don't plan to write a paper when you're on call on a weekend, and try to double dip with res/floor events as much as possible.

Classics courses are really cool, but there are generally fewer choices than POLS. POLS has a lot of wiggle room because of how diverse a field it is - there're historically minded courses, current affairs minded courses, math/economically minded courses, and philosophically minded courses (POLS250, the mandatory second year course is IMO one of the greatest courses at Queen's).

My advice is this: ignore anyone who tells you to take pols because of job opportunities (Boris Johnson has a degree in Classics, not POLS - the difference is marginal). Instead, flip a coin to decide your degree, and take POLS 250 (a full-year course), CLST200 (fall) and CLST201(winter). It should become clear to you over the course of the year which you prefer, and changing your degree plan is fairly easy. Unlike Psychology or other big degrees, POLS and CLST courses rarely fill up super fast, so you should have no issues. If you do this plan, I'd recommend POLS rather than CLST for second year simply because there tend to be more people, so if anything happens you're better off being guaranteed a seat in POLS classes, vs CLST classes which in my experience don't fill up.",2022-01-31,,4.0,False

Could you guys give me some recommendations for picking Math class in order to apply for Aerospace engineering grad school in the future? 

I am in third year Math major and I used to learn 326 and 334 in the last semester. I believe they are useful for my future engineering plan, but I only got C- on both of them, so I realized how hard these kinds of courses are and how stupid I am.

I am approaching the time for applying grad school and for now, I only got 2 engineering related Math class. I only have the next semester (2022Fall) to take some engineering Math course, so some suggestions will be very nice.

FYI, my current GPA is only 3.28/4.3, it's totally my fault and I don't have anything to complain. Therefore, if you have any thoughts about wether it's still possible for me to apply for Aerospace engineering in grad school(some decent school, not just any universities that I never heard), please tell me, don't say it's totally possible just because some extremely rare examples happened before, and I hope this can be my future career, not just pick some easy courses for high GPA, get some offers and fail.

I appreciate your time and suggestions!",2022-01-31,False,0.73,sgqnz7,"I'm an AeroE PhD student at a pretty well-known University in the US. 

It will honestly be a better use of your time to try and fit in Physics and Engineering courses (if this is logistically possible) than trying to take more math courses - seeing how you'll already have far more math background than people applying from engineering undergrads.

Other than that, I'd say try to think of what specialization you will want to hone into in graduate school. The nice thing about grad school is that you don't need to know everything, you just need to know whatever subjects you want to specialize in. If you only want to take control theory courses, then you really don't need to know anything about structural dynamics (for example, but other subjects can obviously be more intertwined). 

Because of this though, some focus areas are going to be a lot harder to transition into than others. Stuff like experimental fluid dynamics and structural dynamics will be difficult if you've never taken a course on either subject. Whereas something like control theory or computational science (a subset of CFD research) could be a good avenue for a math major to transition into. Controls is already really more math than engineering and you might even be able to take the controls courses that Apple kids take. You'd only really be missing an upper-year dynamics course (which honestly might not be strictly necessary from an admissions standpoint, but would require you to eventually learn the material). Computational science is similar. Lots of people doing research in CFD are doing research that is essentially just pure computational science and the fact that the application is fluid dynamics is almost entirely abstracted out.

I personally know math undergrads in my program who are now doing their PhD in control theory and I know at least one EE undergrad that is now doing their PhD in CFD. It's entirely possible to make this type of transition, but you should prepare to patch up the necessary holes in your knowledge.",2022-01-31,,10.0,False

You then declare your major at the end of your first year - the prerequisite is that you generally need to have achieved a certain grade in that major's introductory course (e.g. you might need a ""B"" in first-year History to major in History; only a theoretical example, I don't know if the actual cut-off is a B).

I came out of high school having no idea what I wanted to do, not even a general idea, so I just took as much as I could. My prospective major was psych but I, like every first year psych student, had a rude awakening to how difficult psych is, whereas I came away from intro poli sci wanting to learn more and realizing that it was what I was really interested in and could see a future for myself in. So I ended up declaring poli sci. 

Im now In my second year Im still taking first year courses to figure out a minor. So far Ive taken computer science, linear algebra, and economics as electives outside of my political science classes just to, once again, try to figure out what Im interested in. I liked computer science but I hate the math associated with it so Im settling on econ as a minor and am doing well in the class so im planning on declaring it as a minor at the start of next year. I talked to a guidance counsellor and she said shes seen people not declare a minor until fourth year and still graduate on time. 

In summary, you spend first year figuring out what you want to do so that you dont overcommit to something before you know anything about it which I think is a great thing.

Each clinic employs a few staff lawyers who supervise the work of student caseworkers from the Queen's Faculty of Law.

Each clinic offers free services to low-income Kingston residents in their area of expertise. QLA is more of a general practice clinic that deals with a wider bevy of issues like Small Claims Court files, landlord/tenant disputes (only representing tenants, not landlords), criminal and provincial offence matters, etc.

What you may not know is that in addition to low-income Kingston residents, QLA has a special agreement with the government that allows them to offer their services to Queen's students for free as well, as long as they've paid QLA's annual levy through their student government, regardless of the student's income level. This arrangement has been in place for almost thirty years. Since the start of the pandemic in particular, QLA has seen a huge influx of students coming through its doors for help.

If you needed advice on your rights on that lease you signed right before Queen's announced it was going remote, or got slapped with a $2,000 fine for walking past Aberdeen when there happened to be a party going on, you probably came to QLA for help. And they were able to help you because of this special arrangement QLA has with Legal Aid Ontario - if students pay the levy, they can get free legal help and skip the questions about how much money they (or their parents) have.

In the Fall 2021 AMS referendum, QLA asked for a vote on an increase of the levy from $5.50 per student to $6.00. 63% of voting students voted in favour of this increase. However, since less than 10% of eligible students actually voted in the referendum, the threshold for a passing vote was 65%.

In the upcoming Winter 2022 referendum, the levy is up for triennial review. As a result of the failed Fall 2021 vote, the levy is locked in to its current value of $5.50, so we're no longer talking about an increased fee. **AMS students must vote on whether the levy should remain at $5.50, or be abolished entirely.** Given what happened on the previous vote, there is concern that the entire levy might be in danger. In the event that the levy is abolished, QLA's arrangement with Legal Aid Ontario will have to come to an end, and undergrad students will no longer be able to obtain free legal services just by virtue of shelling out $5.50 each year for what is basically legal insurance.

As you would imagine, students of the law school are very aware of the importance of the law clinics. However, law students are governed by the Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS), not the AMS, and so the ability to keep the AMS levy afloat falls to the undergraduates, some of whom might not have even heard of QLA before and who might not fully understand the importance of the levy.

If you're an undergrad or if you have friends who are still in undergrad, I would urge you to spread the word about the importance of (1) voting in the referendum at all, to avoid another situation where low turnout makes for a harsher threshold, and (2) voting in favour of the continuation of the QLA levy. The referendum will be conducted online next week, on February 1st and 2nd.

My assumption from the goals of the ArtSci Faculty is that they want to create an internal process of faculty members evaluating the degree and program as a whole. The proposal from the ASUS exec candidates seems to be a committee mostly comprised of undergrads (or at least administered by them) to police the syllabuses of professors on the basis of if they are diverse. Whether or not you think the goals from the Faculty are good, this seems to be a very twisted implementation of it. It’s admittedly vague so maybe I got this wrong but I don’t see how else it can be done. I just don’t want a group of undergrads, who are not experts in the thing the prof is teaching, to be able to roll up and police the class based on the race of the authors of the material covered. In fact, I think this would significantly decrease the value of my chemistry degree. I have never felt any connection to ASUS as a student and don’t feel like they represent me at all. I’d rather they not get directly involved in my degree. If the process was directed by the departments themselves and not imposed by ASUS, I would be much more comfortable with it, but in that instance I don't think it would look anything like this.

I hate to break it to you but degree level requirements are already a thing that faculty societies contribute to and work on, and there is work being done to add equity and indigeneity to these requirements in faculties across the university (by both admin and students). It is literally the role of faculty societies to give admin input into the shaping of these requirements. 

**Why do you think adding equity and Indigeneity to your degree decreases its value?** I think that is a pretty whack take...

I think that the fact that most queens students graduate without learning anything about equity, diversity or inclusion is the reason Queens has a (well earned) reputation for producing elitist and problematic alumni. I think it also contributes to why it is such a bad environment for marginalized students. 

I think adding diverse perspectives to our course content and diverse courses to our degree requirements would add a lot of value to our degrees, so I think this is just your opinion based off of the fact that you probably see yourself reflected in your course content already (check your privilege).",2022-01-26,,4.0,False

>*2. Syllabus Review Committee*  
>  
>*The goals detailed by the FAS Dean as well as the expressed interest of the FAS to partake in such curricular reform, we plan on coordinating with Faculty members to initiate a Syllabus Review Committee which will involve both diverse Faculty members and student voices who will discuss course syllabi and measure if they meet equitable standards. From the History Department to the Physics Department, we wish to see diversified curricular improvements across the Faculty of Arts and Science. While the Equity Commissioner and President will be leading this initiative, the Syllabus Review Committee will include at least one student representative external to the Society to provide diverse thought and contributions.*

From page 18 of their platform: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61cb7770df1e8b71e71014d3/t/61ecdc1c4b4b184ff9949408/1642912817405/Team+YEA+Platform+Package.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61cb7770df1e8b71e71014d3/t/61ecdc1c4b4b184ff9949408/1642912817405/Team+YEA+Platform+Package.pdf)

The goals from the Faculty they are referencing are this: 

>*1.“Establish\[ing\] a process to ensure a degree level expectation, learning outcomes, and assessments thereof include: a) global/non-western/Indigenous perspectives; and b) content pertaining to identify, difference and social justice”*  
>  
>*2.“Revis\[ing\] degree requirements to include a required course form a slate of courses carefully designed to educate students about EDI issues”*

My assumption from the goals of the ArtSci Faculty is that they want to create an internal process of faculty members evaluating the degree and program as a whole. The proposal from the ASUS exec candidates seems to be a committee mostly comprised of undergrads (or at least administered by them) to police the syllabuses of professors on the basis of if they are diverse. Whether or not you think the goals from the Faculty are good, this seems to be a very twisted implementation of it. It’s admittedly vague so maybe I got this wrong but I don’t see how else it can be done. I just don’t want a group of undergrads, who are not experts in the thing the prof is teaching, to be able to roll up and police the class based on the race of the authors of the material covered. In fact, I think this would significantly decrease the value of my chemistry degree. I have never felt any connection to ASUS as a student and don’t feel like they represent me at all. I’d rather they not get directly involved in my degree. If the process was directed by the departments themselves and not imposed by ASUS, I would be much more comfortable with it, but in that instance I don't think it would look anything like this.

Interested to hear what other people think about this in a more or less anonymous forum, especially because there is no team running against them so there isn’t really a public discussion about it or anyone to challenge them. I’d be surprised if this was something other students actually want, ASUS to insert themselves in the teaching standards of the departments and particular classes, so would like a vibe check if I’m off the mark here.",2022-01-25,False,0.89,scpmw3,"Takes an arts degree to be exposed to more viewpoints, demands that professors teach them exclusively their already held viewpoint.",2022-01-26,,-4.0,False

What rumours? I mean yes there is *some* racism but it's at the same level as the rest of Canada. I grew up as an Asian male in a predominantly white neighborhood and my experiences at Queens is not any different from where I grew up. Like it does exist, I'm not denying that. But it's what you would see in the rest of Canada. The world's not perfect and people certainly aren't but it's about living with and adapting. At least that's my view point.

>If so who does it and in what ways does it happen.

For example I can recall an instance where someone assumed I was Chinese and spoke Mandarin which is a bit of a problem because 1. I'm not Chinese, 2. I don't speak a second language. It's definitely a case of racial stereotyping but it was not *overt* or *malicious*. From my time on campus I cannot recall a single instance where I've witnessed or experienced anyone being malicious in their intended racism. There probably are some cases, but not ones that I've personally witnessed. And I believe Queen's does have a no tolerance policy against that type of behavior and takes reporting pretty seriously.",2022-01-25,,6.0,False

1. Because you are struggling to reframe how you think. 

2. Because you are also getting better at learning. 

3. Because other people aren’t bothering and you’ll have an advantage over the in employment terms for life. 

Let me give you a concrete example. In CS, really learning data structures and algorithms is hard. Learning them backwards and forwards is very hard. Guess what the interview for a $200,000 programming job is based on?  Go look at the subreddits where people who didn’t put in the hard work whine about it.

I have honestly been in dark places especially in January 2022, with the online learning at home, the fast pace school work, feeling lonely and isolated as hell, feeling depressed and finding it hard to be productive. I am almost there with finishing exam deferrals, but there is one exam I keep requesting to defer multiple times. Has anyone else ever had this situation? I have just come to the conclusion that I am simply not well enough to write any exams in January and wait a bit longer when I am emotionally and mentally feeling better. That’s why I have once again contacted the counsellors/QSAS advisors as well as emailing the exams office to let them know I may not end up writing my deferred exam tomorrow. It’s just so hard. There’s so much anxiety around studying for it too. But everyday since january, for as long as covid existed , I have been feeling extremely depressed, confused, disconnected from reality, and obsessed and addicted to social media and chatting and keeping up with the news and buzz on social media. Because for me it is escapism. It’s become like a drug.

I hear you and what I can say is that the sun will shine again. The omicron variant is running out of steam and restrictions are easing. You will be back to in person classes and have the opportunity to meet new people, make new friends and experience some of what you had expected. It will get better. The current situation if not permanent. Know this and have faith and optimism that this is a short period in your life and you will get through this. You are wise to reach out to express how you feel. Talk to your parents, siblings, friends or other family if you can. Let them know how you feel. 

Regarding your exams, defer if you aren’t ready, even if it means doing the courses again. Your well-being is what matters. If you feel by writing this last exam (and you think you will pass) and think it will ease some of your anxiety, then write it, otherwise continue with deferring it. If you have emailed them and have in writing your request to defer, then it will be deferred when you are ready. The sun will shine in your life again, I’m certain of that so hang in there and trust that it will get better. 

Some suggestions to move you towards some healing: spend time in nature (even if it’s cold right now, spend some time outdoors), download a meditation app and relaxation music and spend time on your phone doing that instead of social media and the news, connect with positive people (perhaps someone you haven’t talked to a while), start a gratitude journal (you’ll be amazed about the positive things you have to be thankful for) which will help direct you to a more positive frame of mind, watch some comedy shows instead of the news. Lastly, plan something fun you want to do in the future that you can look forward to, because the time will come when you will laugh and enjoy again.",2022-01-22,,17.0,False

courses could be 6 weeks or 12 weeks, so 6week courses would be much faster paced since you’re doing the full course in half the time. same goes for 12 week, 6.00 unit courses, as these are typically full year courses that are being condensed into a single semester. for a normal 3.00 unit 12 week course tho, the pace is just like during the school year

Lockdowns work, it's just that people aren't following them accordingly. Look at New Zealand they have a population for 5 million and have less cases than the Kingston area. New Zealand also had zero cases of COVID at one point which is crazy. Half in uni don't care about the protocols and this goes to the start of Covid, multiple people kept going to large gatherings. Covid will end eventually, but now there is no point of lockdowns we are just prolonging the situation.

What I can say is that Smith (Queen's Comm) is generally regarded as one of the top 2 business schools / programs in Canada (the other being Ivey, with both being about equal at the top). They also, generally speaking, are the top two when it comes to recruiting in Investment Banking and Consulting (other schools might rank higher in other industries but for those 2, QComm and Ivey are usually top).

We have industry recruiting nights (one of which being for consulting) where top companies come to talk to queens students, and other on-campus (or zoom lol) recruiting from top consulting firms.

It is probably worth it if this is what you want to do.

Prestige-wise queens has the edge over Ryerson in fields like finance and consulting. If you’re passionate about marketing or accounting, the school you go to doesn’t really matter (prestige isn’t too big of a factor here).

That being said, Queens does have a few special things to take into consideration: a few double degrees (the one with peking), bcom/jd (commerce and queens law), and exchange being common. 

That being said, Ryerson’s tuition is cheaper and they also have co-op, so take it as you will. Best of luck with your decision making!",2022-01-19,,11.0,False

I'm also in computer science so not at all related to commerce. I will, however, say that if I could redo my undergrad and go back to when I was in my early 20s, I'd probably want to get out of Toronto. Ryerson is a commuter school so you'll really have to dig to find a thriving student community. It's there, you just have to look for it, and with the pandemic I'm imagining that it's even harder to get involved. 

Queen's isn't a commuter school so most students live on/near campus. The vibe is totally different. I don't really know what the undergrads get up to but it seems like it's a lot of fun from the little exposure I've had. Graduate school is 100% a different vibe. Less party, more ""get coffee and work"". 

Anyway, I think your decision should lean mostly toward culture and experience. Regarding prestige, maybe commerce cares about that stuff, but if you're set on Ryerson and feel like you need prestige later, just to grad school. I'm sure that it's beneficial in your field.",2022-01-19,,5.0,False

For me it was a cost v. benefit- I wanted the experience of living in residence, living in a city I'd never typically move to (nothing against Kingston but there's like 0 jobs there with what I do currently), and I also wanted the Queens being small enough yet not too large. My brother went to UTor and my sister went to Bishop's, so I liked the in between size wise, and my sister had an amazing time in residence and living away. SO for me the financial cost was worth the benefits I'd take away. I met my husband there and got lucky debt wise, so 10 years later I'm happily married, debt free, doing the job I love, and experiences that I look back on fondly.

If you're not a residence person (which was partially why my brother chose to live at home), then that's a consideration as well. 

Queens Commerce is very reputable, so there is a bit of a ""spend money now, make more later"" (my husband went to med school in the US so I get the debt now, income later). But you need to decide for yourself if you can handle a higher debt now, for potential pay out in a decade. And recognize that your career will come as you invest into it- the Queens name will get you in doors, but how your market yourself will carry deeper weight than the degree alone. 

Personally, as someone who loved Queens and my time as a gael (so much so I decided to do an online degree for fun through queens), I will almost always root for Queens. Cha Gheill! But you need to figure out what factors matter to you in the ""now"".",2022-01-19,,4.0,False

Should I invest in an ipad?",2022-01-17,False,0.84,s6869a,"It depends on what you need from the notes and how you need to use them. For one of my courses last term I just read the module notes and didn't do anything beyond that with them, except when there was discussion posts I'd go back to the week and pick out the key point I needed... For another course that had weekly quizzes I would just make notes of key terms that I knew would come up in the quizzes. 

In another course that had lectures I would listen to the lecture and powerpoint notes, then grab the terms/concepts that were in the lecture and module notes. Likewise, if there were terms in readings that came up in module notes I'd make note of that. But I never copied the modules, just key terms that I knew I needed. HOWEVER, none of my courses have final exams so that's easier to do this in a course that doesn't have a final exam.  

If you're writing the module in full, you're likely not absorbing the key details or information.  If your course has exams- check the exam bank and see what terms are included in the exams, and make notes from those terms.  If your course has a tutorial pay attention to what concepts/phrases come up in the tutorial as the TAs generally are advised by the professor(s) about what concepts are important and will need to be known, vs. stuff that is just included for an overall picture.",2022-01-17,,6.0,False

I personally use Anki cards for the most part when I'm going through the modules and I make notes on my iPad. Then I go over my anki cards as many times as I can within the week.   
If you want more information on how to study, Cal Newports book “how to get straight A’s” was pretty game changing for me. Or look up any videos by him on YouTube. Also, it might be time to get real with your focus skills. Everyone sucks with this, due to social media and severe phone usage.

I write out my notes with pencil and paper. The terms and concepts are coloured. Each section in a module or you can do each module, highlight terms/concepts in different colours.

I break my lecture down into sections for all of my courses. Then I do one section a day per class. I write out my notes with pencil and paper. Each section (or you can do each module) is a different colour for highlighting terms/concepts. It helps me stay organized. 

Before I write my notes I skim through the module section quickly making questions out of heading, key terms etc. Helps introduce you to material and get organized for expectations. I write the questions in another book and colour them the same colour I’m using for that section of the lecture. 

Before I start a new section I quiz myself on what I learned previously. Works super well for me. Similar to the SQ4R method!

It's only logical that a man who has created fundamental texts on societal critique of those who hold power and knowledge accessibility would be discussed in depth in higher educational institutions. The goal of higher education is to develop specialized understanding and refine critical thinking skills, thus conversations about societal design and social ""norms"" (e.g., social rules, oppressors, oppressing factors, social design, psychological paradigms, accessibility to resources, etc.). As critical thinkers in society, we should be asking who and how people benefit from policies and practices to know where societal priorities are. Are we being just? Are we supporting those who need it most? Are we improving the lives for the general public? Are we pursuing something to increase our own power? Are we building or breaking barriers?

After each reading, go back and do a quizlet to secure that knowledge in your brain and redo that quizlet every subsequent day until the day of the exam. 

Also the questions at the end of the module were usually representative of an exam question but I found them to be slightly easier. If you can find some, do previous exams (I don't think I did any but I didn't know Queen's had a test bank at the time).

With that being the context at the time they make the decision, I struggle to imagine that Queen's will make March in person when the hospital burden is so high.  According to this modelling, the ICU numbers will only drop to what they are currently mid-March.  Based on this, I think it's unlikely that they announce a return to in-person instruction this year.  That said, these conditions are constantly changing and there are definitely other models out there that may be more optimistic (or negative).

Sure they will test waters outside the core majors, but that’s all they’ll do. Test waters. Which is what I hope the summation of your interest level in these jobs is. Your dream job in these fields is going to someone who jumped in said waters, headfirst. As far as the Big 4 goes, they don’t poke around at their desired candidates (for worthwhile internships), they actively recruit them.

Sorry to be harsh. Aim for something white collar, maybe in sales or retail banking (for now). Employers like QUIP, but QUIP won’t necessarily give you a tech or finance related placement. Big banks sift through resumes using key words and nepotism. If you don’t know someone who knows someone, and there’s nothing on your resume that indicates an ounce of financial literacy, you are in need of a miracle.

For me that's reading, or watching David Attenborough documentaries (guess my program). Recently I've taken up playing the piano. It's something I learned when I was a kid but dropped when I got older. I'm having fun learning pop culture songs. Everyone needs a distraction of some form. One of my housemates cooks. Another one live streams. It's all about finding an outlet that works for you. While also making sure it's a healthy outlet. I have a friend who started drinking as his outlet. Not recommended.

For the stomach/digestive problems try eating some lighter foods. I know when I'm stressed greasy foods turn my stomach. I find yogurts or tea biscuits are nice. 

Also I find getting a *'penpal'* outside of your immediate family and Kingston community that you can vent to is really great. For me that's one of my old highschool friends. They don't go to Kingston and we don't really meet up in person but we talk online somewhat frequently and it feels nice to vent to someone.

But Hey! Realize youre not alone. Alot of people feel similar things to you. People have been feeling that way since the dawn of time. I like to lightly subscribe to my own interpretation to a line of thought called *stoicism*. Recognize that you can only control what you can control. Things can/will go badly. Picture the worse case scenario. Pretty bleak. But. And a big BUT. You can get through it. It won't be fun or enjoyable, but you will survive. This is honestly how I deal with exam anxiety. I think *what if I fail that exam?* I probably fail the course. What if I fail the course? Well I'll just have to take it again or take a different course I guess. But in the end while not a desirable outcome, it's not the end of everything. You  *can* bounce back.

Realistically, 4 (3 unit) courses in the summer is a bit much. I'd recommend staggering them as 6-week and 12-week courses, so that final assignments don't line up on July/August. There is also no reading week. I did 4 last summer but needed special permission and found it way more difficult than the other summer semesters I have done (6 units per summer).

Normally we only bother to go into that if a student requests a deferral bc of an emergency. But this year because all the deferrals were being automatically granted, some profs may have sent that info to all students in general messages. But he seems to have written. It very poorly and made it seem like the exam was optional.

I am a student from University of Toronto Mississauga who is currently working on her Undergraduate Honours Thesis in Psychology, supervised by Professor Stuart Kamenetsky from the Department of Psychology.

We are currently conducting a study that examines whether overconfidence in knowledge about current issues university students face is predictive of adjustment and well-being and prosocial behaviour above and beyond demographic and dispositional factors. Our study will investigate whether social media usage amongst university students can contribute to overconfidence in knowledge about controversial current issues and whether this can impact well-being and adjustment and prosocial behaviours in university students. The current issues that are investigated include: the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies, physical and mental health and well-being, risky behaviour, disability, climate change, indigenous issues, race issues, sexual orientation and gender diversity. The study has been approved by the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) Ethics Review Committee (Reference #: 2021-13) to ensure that there is no deception involved and this study involves only minimal risk to participants.

We are looking for undergraduate students who are currently studying in a Canadian university to complete an online survey consisting of a total of 10 questionnaires. The entire survey should take a total of 1.5 hours to complete.

The results of this study will contribute to existing research on cognitive biases in Psychology and may provide insights about the role that polarized views on current controversial issues may play in students’ adjustment and well-being. All responses will be kept confidential and strictly anonymous as we are only interested in general trends in overconfidence. Any personal information obtained from the participant will be deleted after the study.

The link to the survey is provided below:

1222,Question about minoring in french,0,rzp1nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/rzp1nr/question_about_minoring_in_french/,5,Question,"I'm thinking of minoring in french but I don't really have any current ability to speak it. Is that okay? And to do so, is it required that I take more advanced french classes or can I take beginner classes? Thanks!:)",2022-01-09,False,0.5,rzp1nr,"Hi! I'm a current French minor nearly done my degree, so I can help you out with this! The short answer is that yes, you will be required to take advanced French courses to complete your degree and yes, you will be graded on your spoken French. The beginner French courses (FRST105, FREN106, FREN107, etc.) do not count towards a French degree. 

The long answer: speaking ability is directly evaluated in a few of the courses (not all) which you're required to take as a French minor, off the top of my head namely FREN150 (one on one graded conversations with TA, the very first french class you take as a minor) and FREN219 (one on one graded conversations with prof). Harshness of grading on speaking ability does depend on the prof (and obviously expectations increase with each year further you advance); to give you an idea of demographics, I would say the large majority of students in the program are either former French Immersion students or native French speakers. I will admit that if you do not have a preexisting knowledge of French, this program would be very hard. If you're working from zero, it's always possible to take the beginner level courses and work your way up to FREN150, but there is a large learning gap from courses like 107 to 150 in terms of tense/conjugation knowledge and speech fluency expectations. 

I honestly wouldn't recommend a French minor UNLESS you *really* want to better your French oral/listening/written skills for employment chances. The degree has very few applications beyond personal betterment (ie. has no grad programs or internships), and like most other degrees, this degree is entirely what you make of it. You can give it your all and come out on the other end better than you entered the minor, or you can BS the conversational aspects and Google Translate your way through the paper writing (no shame, it's just your french won't improve that way). If you are looking into a French minor to enhance employment opportunities, then just having this degree won't be enough; you'll need to engage meaningfully with it to actually have some conversational and writing skills to show for the minor at the end of your program. At the same time, if you really do want to better your French and have something to show for it resume-wise, you can always enroll in a French minor and if you hate it, use the classes you've already completed to obtain one of Queen's Certificates of Competence in French Language.

TL;DR Beginner courses don't count towards a French minor, some classes do require speaking French in conversation for evaluations, and a French degree WILL all-around better your French if you put effort in BUT won't enhance your employment opportunities more than a high school/university-level FSL certificate would.

And is it important for a professor to accept to work with you on email for you to have a strong chance of getting admitted? One prof never replied to my email, the other has turned down saying she has her roster full at the moment.

1263,LSAT Consulting Service,0,ryi3k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/ryi3k6/lsat_consulting_service/,9,Discussion,"Hi all,

I am currently a third-year student who is looking to start a consulting service for Queen's students considering law school and thinking of taking their LSATs. For context, I studied for and took my LSAT in the summer after my first year, and scored in the 97th percentile. 

From both personal experience and from receiving many questions from friends, peers, and friends-of-friends who are planning on beginning their own LSAT journeys, I have noticed that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the studying/preparation process. Personally, I had no idea what the LSAT even entailed before I began studying. Many of the people I have spoken to and have asked me for help are in the same boat. They are unsure of what to study, how to study, which company they should study through etc. 

So, my question is this (for those of you considering writing the LSAT or for those of you who are willing to give this a read and offer some pointers): would you be interested in paying for a consulting service from an individual (who has gone through the process and received a desirable score) to give you some pointers regarding 

1. what the LSAT entails 

2. how I personally studied and set myself up for success (what worked, what didn't, common misconceptions etc.)

3.  some niche tips/tricks that they found useful and wished they knew beforehand

4. and what changes you could make and how to overcome some conceptual obstacles you may be struggling with (this would be in the later stages of a potential client's studying process)

If so, how much would you be willing to pay? What other things would you be interested in learning about from someone that you would hire as an LSAT consultant? As a side note, this is not at all the extent of things the service I am thinking of creating would cover. This idea is clearly in a rough preliminary stage and I would love to hear some feedback/ideas from those who might have some!

 There are companies and tutors out there who offer services similar to this already but they charge absurd amounts of money (anywhere between $200-$1600) and the service they provide is not as personable as someone operating on a smaller scale would be able and willing to provide (in my opinion). 

I was frustrated at seeing stuff like this during my preparation process as test-takers like myself were forced to rely on Reddit, online chatrooms, and blog posts to gather valuable information regarding the LSAT. I also think that people studying for the LSATs could benefit greatly by a) connecting with someone who has gone through the process and can offer mentorship and b) getting to know others who are also going to be studying and taking the test. The studying process can be mentally and emotionally taxing, and it may be beneficial to know and speak to others in the same situation as you.

I believe that there are a significant number of individuals within the Queen's community that are considering law school post-grad. I also believe that a significant number of those individuals would benefit from a consulting service such as the one I have described.

The LSAT is expensive ($300 or something like that iirc), prep courses are even more expensive ($1000s for in person vs 100 or so a month on a platform like 7Sage), and that’s just to have a chance at applying which is $100 per school to apply to.

For everything you discuss offering, I just found online at lawstudents.ca (now the can law forum), Reddit, and talking to current law students to be honest. I found no difference in the quality of information I received on the online forums to speaking with people irl. 

There’s also a strong collegiality among those in the legal field and this kind of information is usually offered for free. For example, something I’m participating in now is a queens law imitative that connects current law students such as myself to speak with prospective law students and guide them through the process as mentors (for free). Before arriving, I also participated in online and in person coffee chats with lots of students and lawyers that were happy to take the time out of their days to speak with me. 

I was happy to pay for some actual LSAT tutoring, but I personally would not have paid for the services you are suggesting here. There’s far too many people doing the same for free and the legal culture in Canada is very friendly.

I'm planning on applying to the Queens BScN program. I'm curious to know what your experiences have been like in this program. Are there any benefits or negative aspects of this program?  Is there anything that makes the BScN program at Queens standout from the other BScN programs in Ontario? What has been your favourite part of the program? Does this program have PBL like the McMaster nursing program?

Any insight you can provide would be awesome! Thanks :)",2022-01-04,False,0.99,rw4dpq,"Hi, fourth-year nursing student here. Yay that you’re going into nursing! I do not know anything about McMaster’s program but I can tell you anything you want to know about Queen’s. I can assure you that Queen’s Nursing provides us an excellent education that goes above and beyond the provincial requirements for nursing curricula. I also know that at Queen’s, we are really lucky to have a wide variety of clinical placements that a lot of other schools cannot offer, such as pediatrics, labor and delivery, and mental health. I have made some wonderful, wonderful friends here at Queen’s.

However, my experiences in the Queen’s SoN have been beyond detrimental to my mental health. I entered the program bright eyed and bushy tailed, so excited to be part of such a wonderful program and profession. After first year, the leadership in the SoN became my (and many others’) biggest obstacle. I, and many I have talked to, have felt that the SoN never compromises in difficult situations or chooses the well-being of its students. I cannot wait to get out of here, and I will never return.

That being said, I have gotten an excellent education, and I cannot compare Queen’s to other schools. Also get more opinions, because I admit that I am incredibly biased against the school.

Best of luck with applications and admissions! Reach out if you have any questions at all (even small!) about nursing schools or applications or anything, I’m happy to help.",2022-01-05,,5.0,False

Also a second year, who is currently a don. I think honestly it is a great opportunity, and you really learn a lot. Unfortunately, most people really only dons as ""writing"" people up, but there is so much more than that going on behind the scenes! As others have mentioned, room size varies based on building. In my building there is little difference, I think my room is slightly larger. In Smith and Brant (I believe) dons have their own washroom. But one thing to remember is that you have very little say (barring accommodations) in what building you get placed in. 

In-terms of time commitment, I think it also can vary based on the building. Some buildings have more students per don, and other buildings are higher conduct. Then there are some buildings which are historically more quiet, and then that can change year to year. As for LLC, I am not an LLC don, however there is one in my building. From my observations, it is some added time commitment in-terms of programming, but they still do a similar number of on-call shifts and office hours. I would only suggest LLC if you are really passionate!

Overall, you have the chance of becoming close with some amazing colleagues, and you have some great interactions with students and can try to make a positive impact!",2021-12-31,,1.0,False

I got accepted into Arts for Fall of 2022 and will most likely be attending Queen's. I know Queen's has a lively social scene, but I was wondering how one can put themselves out there going into their first year. How does one meet people, socialize, and what to expect for frosh week and such?",2021-12-29,False,0.67,rrehzt,"In a normal year, frosh week would have you mixed with a group of other first years in your program, often studying the same stuff, so it's a great way to meet friends if you're alright with some more high energy activities. However, with Covid it's uncertain when frosh week will return to how it was before so a lot of the activities may be virtual.

Otherwise, great ways to meet friends would be people in residence or other first years living outside of residence if you are one of those. For the latter, there is a dedicated group that helps you meet others during frosh week, and for in residence friends you will have residence orientation with plenty of opportunity to meet your floormates.

The best suggestion I have is clubs and/or student jobs. There's a club for almost everything on campus, and if you can't find it at Queen's then there is likely a group within Kingston that takes part in your interests. As for student jobs, you can apply to these in September through the Alma Mater Society and you meet a lot of great people while getting paid to work part-time jobs that typically have flexible hours. Both clubs and jobs typically have socials as well for more friend-making opportunities, but official socials hinge on if school is in-person or online. That said, unofficial socials are typically run regardless. Hope this helps!",2021-12-29,,7.0,False

One major difference is that Carleton has a dedicated faculty of Cognitive Science, and so you'll have professors who specialize in the area over other areas.

The Cog Sci program at Carleton is also very broad. It gives you a ton of breadth in the humanities, sciences, and math courses that you take. The downside is that it's less focused from a career perspective, so it may not lead as directly to a field you want to be in if you already know where you want to be.

That last point doesn't have to be a downside, though. I went in to my undergrad thinking that neuroscience was 100% the direction that I wanted to go.

1639,Thoughts on Online Classes and Exams as a Second Year (first time in-person),54,rn4jvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/rn4jvp/thoughts_on_online_classes_and_exams_as_a_second/,20,Discussion,"EDIT: TLDR: skip to last two paragraphs 

It's definitely true that many people wanted to cancel in-person exams due to the stress and difficulty of exams, and that due to the COVID outbreaks it would've likely been shut down regardless of the petition and student input. 

We have also had a chance over the past two years to evaluate the impact of online classes on a student's academic achievement (aka how much of the information they are really learning, understanding, and retaining and how well they are doing on assessments). Online classes are not perfect, but they are still a popular option due to the many imperfections of the classic university experience which include paying lots of tuition in addition to rent, finding places to live, cooking and cleaning/having good personal hygiene, and being independent while most students struggle with mental health and have little built-in accommodation for the average person. 

As a second-year, this semester was my first in-person and on-campus and I was severely dissappointed. Some of my math and computer science classes that used to have tutorials or labs had axed that because it wasn't all that necessary for the learning experience entirely, or they had moved them online and made them optional, so outside of lectures I only had one class with in-person components where I got to meet people and no, I did not make any friends. Rent and food are very expensive and I'm grateful to be going home now. 

I appreciate the university (along with many other schools) has been trying to create more accommodations for students for mental health but I also want to mention that these are very necessary but *band-aid* solutions that are never going to truly improve without getting to the root of the issue. University is full of ambiguous expectations and arbitrary grading (of which exams are a prime example) which has sucked out all the joy of learning. Who wants to work themselves to the bone only to fail, consistently, in courses that are full of arbitrary expectations and marked on a few heavily-weighted assignments? School is a nightmare, and thinking back I can't believe we have these stupid examinations from freshman year of high school onwards. 

Almost everyone in the university is a smart and capable person that does not want to have to game the system and take advantage of every loophole possible just to get by every semester. It's dehumanizing and a never-changing cycle of seeking temporary ""help"" that is never enough. For the vast majority of us, our mental health problems are situational, but this does not make them any less valid or damaging. Real people are in real distress that could cause them to harm themselves or cause permanent damage in their lives because of a temporary circumstance (which is being in school), and because they do not have an otherwise ongoing condition and are qualified to be here maybe we should find ways to have fair, built-in course policies that are designed to help everyone. 

Online exams have their drawbacks, mainly being that you are taking the same outdated, inane academic practice and potentially making it open-book (which is good although it's still unreasonably time-restrained and probably doesn't test on topics equally) or even worse you're making students jump through the examity or whatever online proctoring hoops with the risk of technological difficulties. My math exam was turned into a take-home exam (like the other tests we've had in the course) and I can understand professors skepticism on take-home exams but I think if exam-like assessments are required they should be weighted less and distributed evenly chronologically, like a series of tests, which is much better for student performance and mental health. Or perhaps more projects can be incorporated into other courses besides the sciences so that students can't cheat and have to put original work in. 

But either way, exams are outdated and inherently unfair (people can have different exam schedules that affect how much time they have to study, or the exam is unexpectedly largely based on one topic they didn't study, etc) and I hope professors can let them go and instead of becoming bitter about online exams let those go as well and find new alternative forms of assessment that are more honest and fair from both sides. I know exams are used as a nice way to distribute marks more evenly, because after all if classes were a little more straightforward a lot more people would be doing a lot better! This doesn't have to be ""grade inflation"" if you don't want it to be - many courses like PSYC 100 are incredibly basic and use the same strategies to trip up students and make them fail, but if they wanted to be fair and still have a good distribution of grades they would simply have to make the material or assignments more rigorous while being straightforward so that it benefits students by not just being a waste of time and money. 

My vision for the future is a more personalized academic experience that can accommodate student's different schedules and responsibilities without them having to go and have to ask a mental health professional for a note to get an extension even though they are having real and valid mental distress because this is a lot of extra work for students and instructors and can clog the system for people who need long-term psychiatric help and not those in temporary situations that are valid and real but will eventually resolve on their own. 

When it comes to homelessness the most effective solution is to solve the root of the problem and simply provide housing (although in some cases the root of the problem is different, like an addiction for example, and in that case housing and addiction need to be directly treated, etc). Similarly, the best solution for student mental health issues isn't necessarily providing more psychiatric services but also changing the education system in a way that does not compromise its integrity but isn't inherently designed to make students fail. 

Thank you for reading.",2021-12-23,False,0.88,rn4jvp,"I've experienced a range of exams in engineering. Psyc and humanities exams may be different but I can tell you things that I think make a good/bad exam:

Good exam:

* Uses more derivation, application, thinking type problems over just knowledge questions.
* (One option) Open book and easy enough exam, but if you have to read half the content to get to the answers you run out of time
* (Other option) Insanely difficult/course-specific exam that searching online would not help, nearly everyone expected not to get full solution but grading is based on process.
* Most of these are difficult to mark, but really reinforce learning and discourage cheating.

Bad exam:

* Reliant on getting definitions word-for-word
* Overweighted multiple choice, T/F sections (>20% of test)
* Copies problems verbatim from previous years but expects no cheating (Puts honest students at a major disadvantage).
* Most of these are products of laziness.

The argument for exams are a means of standardization, to prevent a university from just passing everyone because they noticed 'every student's potential' if they were able to concoct a 'personalized academic experience' for each student. As it is organized now, each course has a number of objectives you should meet by the end of it, and exams are there to show that you can meet them without help. The more 'personalized' university programs become the more difficult it might be to quantify what it means to have completed a particular,  course, program or degree.  

I don't agree with some aspects of it, such as exams that are worth 50% of your grade or more. They are stupid and cheapen work put into assignments and quizzes.

Lastly, programs like Examity and Proctortrack suck ass. Similar to the features of Bad Exams, laziness drives course administrators to these kinds of solutions to a large extent.",2021-12-24,,6.0,False

Online exams have their drawbacks, mainly being that you are taking the same outdated, inane academic practice and potentially making it open-book (which is good although it's still unreasonably time-restrained and probably doesn't test on topics equally) or even worse you're making students jump through the examity or whatever online proctoring hoops with the risk of technological difficulties. My math exam was turned into a take-home exam (like the other tests we've had in the course) and I can understand professors skepticism on take-home exams but I think if exam-like assessments are required they should be weighted less and distributed evenly chronologically, like a series of tests, which is much better for student performance and mental health. Or perhaps more projects can be incorporated into other courses besides the sciences so that students can't cheat and have to put original work in. 

But either way, exams are outdated and inherently unfair (people can have different exam schedules that affect how much time they have to study, or the exam is unexpectedly largely based on one topic they didn't study, etc) and I hope professors can let them go and instead of becoming bitter about online exams let those go as well and find new alternative forms of assessment that are more honest and fair from both sides. I know exams are used as a nice way to distribute marks more evenly, because after all if classes were a little more straightforward a lot more people would be doing a lot better! This doesn't have to be ""grade inflation"" if you don't want it to be - many courses like PSYC 100 are incredibly basic and use the same strategies to trip up students and make them fail, but if they wanted to be fair and still have a good distribution of grades they would simply have to make the material or assignments more rigorous while being straightforward so that it benefits students by not just being a waste of time and money. 

My vision for the future is a more personalized academic experience that can accommodate student's different schedules and responsibilities without them having to go and have to ask a mental health professional for a note to get an extension even though they are having real and valid mental distress because this is a lot of extra work for students and instructors and can clog the system for people who need long-term psychiatric help and not those in temporary situations that are valid and real but will eventually resolve on their own. 

When it comes to homelessness the most effective solution is to solve the root of the problem and simply provide housing (although in some cases the root of the problem is different, like an addiction for example, and in that case housing and addiction need to be directly treated, etc). Similarly, the best solution for student mental health issues isn't necessarily providing more psychiatric services but also changing the education system in a way that does not compromise its integrity but isn't inherently designed to make students fail.

1643,Thoughts on Online Classes and Exams as a Second Year (first time in-person),54,rn4jvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/rn4jvp/thoughts_on_online_classes_and_exams_as_a_second/,20,Discussion,"EDIT: TLDR: skip to last two paragraphs 

It's definitely true that many people wanted to cancel in-person exams due to the stress and difficulty of exams, and that due to the COVID outbreaks it would've likely been shut down regardless of the petition and student input. 

We have also had a chance over the past two years to evaluate the impact of online classes on a student's academic achievement (aka how much of the information they are really learning, understanding, and retaining and how well they are doing on assessments). Online classes are not perfect, but they are still a popular option due to the many imperfections of the classic university experience which include paying lots of tuition in addition to rent, finding places to live, cooking and cleaning/having good personal hygiene, and being independent while most students struggle with mental health and have little built-in accommodation for the average person. 

As a second-year, this semester was my first in-person and on-campus and I was severely dissappointed. Some of my math and computer science classes that used to have tutorials or labs had axed that because it wasn't all that necessary for the learning experience entirely, or they had moved them online and made them optional, so outside of lectures I only had one class with in-person components where I got to meet people and no, I did not make any friends. Rent and food are very expensive and I'm grateful to be going home now. 

I appreciate the university (along with many other schools) has been trying to create more accommodations for students for mental health but I also want to mention that these are very necessary but *band-aid* solutions that are never going to truly improve without getting to the root of the issue. University is full of ambiguous expectations and arbitrary grading (of which exams are a prime example) which has sucked out all the joy of learning. Who wants to work themselves to the bone only to fail, consistently, in courses that are full of arbitrary expectations and marked on a few heavily-weighted assignments? School is a nightmare, and thinking back I can't believe we have these stupid examinations from freshman year of high school onwards. 

Almost everyone in the university is a smart and capable person that does not want to have to game the system and take advantage of every loophole possible just to get by every semester. It's dehumanizing and a never-changing cycle of seeking temporary ""help"" that is never enough. For the vast majority of us, our mental health problems are situational, but this does not make them any less valid or damaging. Real people are in real distress that could cause them to harm themselves or cause permanent damage in their lives because of a temporary circumstance (which is being in school), and because they do not have an otherwise ongoing condition and are qualified to be here maybe we should find ways to have fair, built-in course policies that are designed to help everyone.

Thank you for reading.",2021-12-23,False,0.88,rn4jvp,"Note that everything I’m about to say is from the view of an engineering student.

The purpose of exams is to distinguish between the top students and the bottom ones. Having take home exams promotes group work and is almost never an accurate representation of an individual’s understanding of the course.

Having exams at the end of a semester is what makes it equitable. It’s imperfect, but spreading them out through the semester means a much higher chance of conflicts with tests, assignments, and projects in other courses. Having it at the end of the semester ensures that each student only needs to focus on exams. You’re given the schedule months in advance and should be preparing accordingly. A crappy exam schedule is the much lesser of two evils

I understand that they are a huge mental strain on some, but keeping up with content throughout the semester greatly alleviates that stress. As I said, you have months in advance to prepare a study schedule.

Do you think it gets easier after school? You’re going to be given unreasonable deadlines throughout your life and have to learn how to manage your own mental health. You’re not going to be able to always fit everything around your own schedule and it will be partially dictated by others.

There was no need to study hard. I did my homework, did the extra work after school (helped that I did sports and there was an hour between school and practice so I used it for homework and the after-school help teachers offered). I did a bunch of AP and advanced classes so first year engineering was only about 20% new material.

Second year was a major challenge, but I scraped by. Third year was a gut punch and I failed a class. I couldn’t believe it. Fortunately, I just barely failed and was able to write a supplemental exam. I studied all summer and ended up with the best mark on the exam.

After that, things kind of clicked. I finally realized what studying methods worked for me. I was able to be more effective and efficient in my study habits.

Obviously I can’t speak for you, but I’ve also tutored abs taught a bunch of high school and university students and it often relates back to major gaps in foundational concepts/knowledge (can’t build a house on a poor foundation!) or under-developed study habits to reinforce or cement learnings.

The best thing I did was ask for help. And I did not do that until after I failed a class. Had I started earlier and realized that I could not just solo climb out of the pit I had dug I probably would have had stronger second/third year marks.

There are lots of resources available, unfortunately I’m too out of the loop (check my flair…) to know what is available to you right now, but the sooner you seek help the sooner you may feel more comfortable.

I just wanted to share with you a really weird situation. For some reason the mods, or one in particular, over at /r/KingstonOntario *really* don't want me to share my experiences which are similar to an article I saw about a Toronto Timmies.

Maybe keep my experiences in mind whenever you think about getting something to eat or drink at Tim Horton's. I know a lot of Queen's students are customers, and I believe people should know if the products they are being served are sub par.

So here are some of the things I witnessed that I believe people should know:

At one location:

* Bakers touch bagels after handling cash

* Staff using their bare hands to pick up ice cubes from countertops and place them inside customers drinks

* Staff go to make sandwiches at the bagel bar after touching the broom or mop, which get taken into the bathroom and do not get wiped down afterwards

At two Kingston locations:

* The buckets for frozen lemonade and iced cappuccino are not cleaned, rarely rinsed, they ferment, and sit directly on the floor under sinks

Here is the news post about the Toronto incident: https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2021/12/toronto-tim-hortons-employee-caught-camera-using-fingers-ice-cinnamon-buns/

As for my communications with other managers from different cities, I was told that they have multiple buckets for the frozen lemonade and iced capp mixes, they always use a clean one when making a fresh batch, and they have specific places to place them where they do not directly touch the floor, or sit under sinks where things can fall in them.

I have a geo-eng degree and 90% of my courses are A&S courses. I sat side by side with Science students.

One misstep and everything goes to shit. 

I actually applied to transfer out of engineering as I felt more like a Science student but back then Geology was WAY over subscribed and I had to stick with Eng. Though to be honest as I said the difference was minor. 

The introduction of the stronger design spine (APSC 100, 200, etc.) meant that there was a pretty design centric spine to the various eng. disciplines that wasn't really there before. It was there in spirit, and some profs did a lot of design stuff, but it wasn't baked into the program.

The main misconception I see in engineers and science students is that they think they took real math courses. They took real _applied_ math courses.

Then when she tried to talk to me I couldnt hear her so she told me to check my audio settings, so I had to sit there in screenshare troubleshooting my audio for like 15 minutes which was super awkward, I told her all the other sound on my pc was working so she made a Zoom call instead of using the examity extension. Then we finally actually start the setup process in which she made me do the room and workspace scan (which was super unserious; I could have EASILY finessed it and put a cheat sheet at my feet or under my keyboard) and then of course read all of the standard examity and exam specific rules out loud to me one at a time. Finally at 7:35 my 2 hour exam period started and I was done at 9:30. 

It really annoys me too because the class was political theory which is extremely general understanding and critical analysis based, and I feel like a closed note exam was totally unneccesary.

The commerce students showed up well dressed, were eloquent, gave fabulous presentations, and in every other way were average. Nowhere near the technical top of the class, but hey, they sold what they knew well.

I was bitching at my wife (who was very high up at a major software company at the time) about people with those kinds of skills making way more money, e.g. in commissioned sales, and her response was more or less 'if your sales people aren't good your technical people have no market, you have no money, and you are dead.' 

So... ""smart,"" often libertarian (shudder) pretentious, etc. perhaps, but... unless we restructure society there is a very specific place for those people and it is a place I have zero interest in going myself. 

Also, I have to say that I never got the sense that they 'looked down' at the rest of the class. They had a path to way more income, they knew it, and they knew it was a choice, that's what I'd imagine. The coolest presentation that year in technical terms was so far beyond what they did that I think they knew they weren't the 'smartest people in the room.'

I put that in quotes because it is kind of meaningless. Arguing whether da Vinci or Einstein was smarter misses the point. Glorifying genius' does as well. There are many many kinds of smart, and far far more kinds of stupid. 

Also, Elon isn't smart, he is an asshole, he bought Tesla, he didn't create it, and he is a criminal. He started rich with income from very questionably run businesses (family) and as they say, the first 10 million is the hardest.

And landlords, especially with students, will try to take advantage of your situation and force you into another fixed term. If you don't resign and don't give notice, then after the initial end date you're on a month to month, which only requires you to give 60 days notice, as opposed to the end of the fixed term. 

In terms of first and last month- no since you're already living there, they'd already have your last month rent. 

One thing that often gets forgotten is that you are owed interest on the last month of rent, but often landlords won't return it unless it's asked for, so make sure at the end of your tenancy you ask for the interest on it.",2021-12-20,,14.0,False

About social life, we rly need to wait and see. Kingston rn is the epicentre of covid of Ontario, so that’s not good. Let’s hope to maybe go hybrid or smth after feb 28. 


About houses, I don’t recommend leasing in University Avenue or Aberdeen St. During Homecoming specially, your house can be subject of damages and vandalism - some landlords are picky af. I’d recommend to live in the ghetto, specially if u like partying, but not on these streets.


Queen’s motto is: “Work hard play hard.” We generally bust our asses during the week and then party sometimes starting Thursday - we did that in Res.


Sports culture at Queen’s is - in my opinion - one of the best if not the best in Canada. The whole small - town vibe is great, cuz u have every sport court/facility/field walking distance. If you’re interested in learning a sport, there are a lot of options; you can either hire a coach or get into a club and just have fun. If u are good enough, u can try to get into the Queen’s team.


There are some clubs that are focused solely in outdoor activities. There’s a cool winter ski club that goes to Montreal every winter - it’s damn nice.


About the commerce course, u should def ask an academic advisor. It’s free, and they give great advice since they’re also students - mostly 3rd and 4th so they’ve seen it all pretty much",2021-12-19,,3.0,False

Thank you!",2021-12-18,False,0.72,rjc2cq,"Hi! I’m in fourth year nursing at Queen’s and here are my thoughts:

1. it is a very tight-knit program. I have really enjoyed the community and all of my peers! Absolutely could not have made it through this program without the community.

2. I have gotten an excellent education. The Queen’s nursing NCLEX passing rate on the first try is 100%. We take courses that cover material that goes beyond what the nursing regulatory body in Ontario requires, so we do have extra knowledge when we graduate. I don’t know how I will feel once I enter the workforce, though! We’ll see.

3. I’m sorry, I can’t really help with the admissions aspect because I transferred in from another university program. I imagine they use the information/vibes from the PSE to understand why you want to be in nursing and why you’ll be a good fit for the profession. 

4. Lots of placements that are well-rounded. In second year you start with a long term care placement, then a low-acuity med/surg placement. Third year has maternity and peds placements along with psychiatry and higher-acuity med/surg placements. Fourth year you do a community health placement, and then your final practicum.

5. While the placements are well-rounded, they are the widely agreed-upon absolute worst part of this program. Each clinical day is a highly-scrutinized test rather than an opportunity to learn. Your success in each placement depends significantly on your relationship with your clinical instructor. (Imagine: you do many wonderful things during your clinical day, but when your evaluations come back, the instructor ignores the good things and only mentions the two small mistakes you made and blows them out of proportion. Those mistakes are then used as reason to fail you. No exaggeration- this is what happens to SO many students.) Instructors pick favorites and least-favorites in their clinical groups early on in the semester and that completely determines a student’s experience. I’ve had clinical instructors who I have loved but other students felt targeted by them and failed, and I’ve had instructors who have traumatized me but others have loved. It’s wack. The whole clinical system needs to change to reduce bias and improve learning opportunities.

6. Every student I have talked to across several graduating years has felt completely unsupported by the school. For example, if a student has felt targeted by their clinical instructor and talks to the school about it, the school ALWAYS sides with the instructor. The school claims to support students’ mental health/wellbeing etc but repeatedly makes decisions that counteract that claim. Of 2021 graduates who were surveyed about their satisfaction with the program, 95% said they would NOT choose Queen’s again.

7. The school boasts about its 100% NCLEX passing rate. The only reason that their passing rate is that high is because they fail everyone who might not pass the NCLEX on the first try. The class of 2021 started with 96 students in first year and only 54 of those students graduated in 2021.

I am very grateful for the education I have received from Queen’s Nursing. I have had some wonderful experiences and met amazing people whom I know will all be excellent nurses. This was not worth the trauma that this school put us through. While I would choose nursing 100x over, I absolutely would not choose Queen’s again. I don’t know what other schools are like, so do your research, but there have to be better programs out there.

Please reach out if you have any questions or want names of people to talk to, either faculty or students! I’m proud of you for choosing nursing and I know you’ll be a wonderful nurse! Best of luck <3",2021-12-20,,5.0,False

Thank you!",2021-12-18,False,0.72,rjc2cq,"1. You learn a lot of fluff. Most of first semester in first year is useless, nursing research in third year and don’t get me started on the stupid community theory courses in fourth year. In saying that though, a lot of other nursing programs are a lot worse. The best part about Queen’s is the community that you build. The nursing class is super tight, and help each other out all the time. It’s always a team energy. Also our placements. Friends of mine in other nursing programs don’t start clinical until third year, or only have med surg placements through out their whole program. And there are SO many different fields in nursing, outside of the hospital. So Queen’s gives you a wide exposure to placements. Lastly, I’d say the reputation of the nursing program. It’s helped me out in two job interviews as the hospitals knew that Queen’s graduates good nurses. But I think that’s due to the wide variety of placements/ and the quality of the students. 
2. Placements start in 2nd year. 2nd year is med surg, 3rd year is 6 week rotations through mental health/medsurg/ mother child/OB and like two shifts on L&D/ and peds. They try and give you one community placement during third year as well- so for mental health there’s the prison (have to have a car), for peds there is PACU at hotel dieu /burr 4 C+A/the outpatient peda clinic at hotel dieu, public health and for OB there’s an outpatient women’s clinic at KGH. Community had the lamest placements ever with covid- it was basically free labor for the project supervisors. We had to  follow a model that our seminar leader had no idea what the model was. And t the project supervisors had no clue what the model was that your seminar leader wanted done.. they just wanted their project done a certain way 😂 It was a mess with Zoom tbh. And, I’m still salty about it. 
3. I’d agree with everything the other fourth year nursing student said. You are so nit picked as a student. I’d just say keep your head down and ask your co-assigned nurse everything. And more then your clinical instructor. After 206 which is your first clinical course , I hardly ever asked my clinical instructors anything. I practiced safely but I always tried to ask my co-assigned nurse to do the skill with me or any of my questions before asking my clinical instructor. ALWAYS practice safely, but try as much as possible to ask your co-assigned nurse before your clinical instructor.  The clinical instructor documents everything on your eval… so if you ask a stupid question, it’s there and in more than one spot. Again, all depending on who the instructor was. And people do fail… the third year med surg course fails a lot of people. Tbh, the OB instructors were the nicest and most approachable ones I ever had. They’re lovely. And if you ever have an issue with your co-assigned nurse document document document! My instructor gave me a hard time because my co-assigned nurse was bullying me… and then another nurse stood up for me. And that’s the only reason why I didn’t get in trouble was because that RN came up while my instructor was tearing me a new one. 
4. I graduated from the class of 2021… and I concur with everything that the 4th year said tbh. Queen’s is a good program, but it’s tough. I would go back because some of the things I’ve heard from graduates in other programs are sketchy ? But it’s miserable. 2nd year was brutal- you study all the time. But the friends I made are hands down worth it. And I learned a lot from my co-assigned nurses. So, I would pick Queen’s again because of the placements and the friends I made. Not because of the profs/ the clinical instructors/ Cheryl/ or the support from the program. Barb Bolton is the most useless person I have ever met. I’ve had numerous silly dealings with her but my favourite is I asked her about doing a dual degree in economics and she said “I don’t know- you’ll have to ask the Econ department.” I went to ask the Econ department and they told me that Barb would be the one to know…. And I gave up on that. But make sure you toss your brain out the door if you ever have to see her. 
4. I think the PSE does help. I had a 92.5 average and I heard on March 5 that I got in. I also did a victory lap and there are lots of students who did a victory lap in the program as well. I always felt that I was behind because I did one… but it helped a lot with maturity and not sweating the small stuff. They will try and make you sweat the small stuff. As long as you pass that’s all that matters. 

All in all, I would choose it again. I just wish I would’ve been a lot less naive about the program. If you have any more questions, feel free to DM me. 

My last PSA: do not buy any textbooks in first year before the first day except for the psych code. All the first years are keeners and spend so much $$ on textbooks. I literally got a textbook “used” off Amazon for $25 when people had spent 150 on it from the bookstore. Just hold your horses and wait and see. The textbooks/courses have changed since I was in first year… but even in second/third year you never used it, or used it once.",2021-12-23,,2.0,False

I’ve internalized a lot because I don’t want to burden him when I WFH and do online courses. But I burnt out in October- i completely stopped doing my course and just didn’t do readings and barely put effort into a discussion post. I started sleeping and not eating, but couldn’t figure out what my issue was (turned out some of that was a kidney infection that caused sepsis but that’s another story).  I was motivated to take care of my husband and do my job but nothing else. It got really bad and I didn’t even recognize myself by mid November. My husband realized it when he talked about ordering tickets for spider man and I didn’t react at all. I finally broke down fully and the weight of this released. And it felt needed 

One thing he told me was- this is real for each of us and while it may feel like he has it worse, it doesn’t negate my experience. I am an extrovert who went from being with people all the time to working from home and because of his job as an ER doctor I also stopped doing much outside the home to prevent unintentionally spreading covid. For a while he wasn’t even at home so I was fully  alone. And that has been real for me, and internalizing these feelings won’t make them disappear. These feelings are there and will come up and surface at (likely) the most in opportune time. Grief is not a competition, nor is depression. It’s real to all of us in our own way

Be compassionate on yourself, others. Help out and support when/where/if you can. Do your part. We all have to come together and keep truckin’ through this. Do what you CAN control in your life and life in general. You do have grasp on many aspects. There’s always going to be the loud, negative minority.

Well I’m covid positive, possibly not gonna be able to see my family over Christmas, had to defer two exams so I need to write them in January (right when online school picks up) and guess what? Millions of people still have it so much worse than me. Does that mean I don’t get to be upset? Of course not.

You don’t have to stack your circumstances up against those of everyone else before deciding how miserable you’re allowed to feel. It’s a shit situation for everyone and everyone is allowed to feel shit about it. 

Also remember, those doctors and nurses feel done too. On the outside they’re still going, but inside they’re just as fed up as you are (source: like half of my family, including my mom, are nurses). And you’re still going too. 

As for advice on how to deal, I was feeling like this around January of last year, and therapy worked wonders for me. There are tons of great places in Kingston that do virtual therapy, and feeling down because of covid is like the number one thing they’re dealing with right now, I’m sure you could find someone who could help you.

1. There isn't that much data on Omicron, but currently, it seems like there's a much lower risk for severe outcomes. Even at only two doses, Pfizer expects a 70% efficacy (not yet peer-reviewed) at protecting from hospitalization. In South Africa, there's a 1.7% instead of 19% rate of hospitalization, so a 91% decrease in hospitalizations compared to their previous delta outbreak. It feels like Queen's should've waited to see how Omicron would pan out. I fully realize the alternative, a last-minute decision, would've caused upset as well, but it's not like people can pull out of leases rn, and the financial drop date for classes is still way later.
2. Everyone in Ontario will have access to a booster dose starting this Monday, meaning it's likely that most people can receive their 3rd dose by the end of January. Requiring this to return, and even having these on campus, would not be a stretch. Dr. Fauci said recently that he believes the 3rd dose alone will be sufficient enough to curb Omicron.
3. Realistically, I don't think people are getting COVID from classes, labs, or tutorials (especially small group tutorials). Anecdotally, I don't know anyone who got COVID from going to class. It seems to be mostly outings (what was going on in some of those Kingston bars was most definitely illegal).
4. Widespread access to on-campus and rapid testing could help curb the spread. This was not present at all last semester. Why not do a later start combined with access to these sorts of measures?
5. Other universities have only delayed until the end of January, so it feels harsh.

To be cynical I think that (potential) start date - which we’ll be told if it’s real in early February - is just “please don’t drop out or defer.” They’ll announce the rest of the semester is online then, conveniently after the cut-off dates for dropping out, deferring and paying fees.

1. There isn't that much data on Omicron, but currently, it seems like there's a much lower risk for severe outcomes. Even at only two doses, Pfizer expects a 70% efficacy (not yet peer-reviewed) at protecting from hospitalization. In South Africa, there's a 1.7% instead of 19% rate of hospitalization, so a 91% decrease in hospitalizations compared to their previous delta outbreak. It feels like Queen's should've waited to see how Omicron would pan out. I fully realize the alternative, a last-minute decision, would've caused upset as well, but it's not like people can pull out of leases rn, and the financial drop date for classes is still way later.
2. Everyone in Ontario will have access to a booster dose starting this Monday, meaning it's likely that most people can receive their 3rd dose by the end of January. Requiring this to return, and even having these on campus, would not be a stretch. Dr. Fauci said recently that he believes the 3rd dose alone will be sufficient enough to curb Omicron.
3. Realistically, I don't think people are getting COVID from classes, labs, or tutorials (especially small group tutorials). Anecdotally, I don't know anyone who got COVID from going to class. It seems to be mostly outings (what was going on in some of those Kingston bars was most definitely illegal).
4. Widespread access to on-campus and rapid testing could help curb the spread. This was not present at all last semester. Why not do a later start combined with access to these sorts of measures?
5. Other universities have only delayed until the end of January, so it feels harsh.

An end of Jan term start date would push exams into May and then summer jobs would start a few weeks later. For students paying for/contributing to their own education losing 2-3 weeks of work could be a lot of money.

You're right that there isn't a lot of data on omicron yet, and the little data that is out there is saying that it's more contagious but less virulent than other covid variants. Ok... but what if we start seeing different results and suddenly people start developing weird post recover side effects? I know that might sound extreme, but I'd rather the school take a more conservative approach to minimize the spread of omicron on campus while people get their booster shots and hopefully case numbers will go down in KFLA during that time

I think I speak for the majority when I say, online school is not what I wanted, and I tend to perform much better and learn much more with in person classes. But unfortunately, we’re stuck with it for at least two months. 

According to our subreddits resident brofessor u/Random profs are spending the break trying to formulate a better online experience than last year for us, and a thread of student feedback [might get passed around](https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/rhvj5n/all_winter_term_classes_to_be_remote_until_at/hotuapy/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3)  and examined by said profs. Not a guarantee, but I’m not doing anything until Christmas so I figured I’d start things off with my feedback and give others a place to chime in as well, maybe some of the profs will see it and take it to heart. Remember guys, they don’t wanna be online either.

Here are my notes: 

- Asynchronous lectures are way better. Just record and post them. There’s really no reason I can think of to require students to attend a zoom conference for part of their attendance grade. All it does is mess up people with poor wifi or who are in a different time zone. It’s totally fine to have synchronous lectures to try and preserve some human connection, but please don’t make them mandatory, it really hurts those of us who don’t have reliable connections. **Edit: People seem split on this. With many people saying they need the structure, which I totally get. If for no other reason than selfish ones, I’ve gotta stand by my opinion that I don’t think they should be mandatory. It punishes students for having poor connections.**

- Please don’t use remote proctoring. It’s invasive, clearly not secure, overly stressful, inconsistent (last year it randomly closed down my digital formula sheet which was allowed and completely screwed me on an exam). And it doesn’t even prevent cheating, it’s not that hard to tape a paper to your wall, or just have a friend who wrote the test earlier in the timeframe tell you what’s on it. Which brings me to

- Assignments/Takehomes > Tests. Honestly, as much as I despise remote proctoring and will never fully forgive queens for encouraging it, I understand why some profs felt it was necessary. It’s very easy to cheat in an online setting, but the solution isn’t to force students to install spyware on their computers, it’s to create assessments that have different rules. As an honest student who’s grades dropped significantly online, I hated hearing stories of students cheating so easily and coasting along with their 4.0 gpas. Giving take home assignments that allow for collaboration within groups and the use of notes etc evens the playing field, while at the same time eliminating the need for remote proctoring. 

- **Edit: The following opinion (about discussion posts) is unpopular. I’m gonna leave it here as I originally wrote it so the comments that reference it below still make sense, but with this acknowledgement that I’m in the minority in case someone only reads the main post. Also, of all the points I made, it is definitely the one I care the least about.** Get rid of discussion posts. Nobody takes those seriously, I had about five copy/paste templates on my computer that I cycled through each week. Like, I don’t understand the point, just give us an easy 2 minute quiz on that weeks content to ensure we’re keeping up if that’s something you care about. The whole “write you own paragraph and reply to two peers” thing is just a time waster.

I’m on my second degree of the pandemic and I can say with absolute certainty that remote proctoring is not worth the amount of stress and confusion it causes. Just make the exam a take home and mark on a curve if possible.

2. If you have to have them, diversify weekly participation activities. Honestly, having to write a weekly 500-word discussion post for five courses is harder and more stressful than writing a single 30-page assignment. If you need asynchronous participation activities either make these posts casual (I.e., share something you found interesting about the readings), or diversify them so the students aren’t completing the same repetitive activities week after week for 2% apiece. Also helps if they only have to post a limited number of weeks over the semester. 

3. Integrated assignments (or whatever they’re called) are mint. Have the students begin with a small assignment worth 5% or something which they snowball into their final assignment. It allows them to feel a sense of progress and growth over the course of the year, where otherwise they’d feel like they’re just putting out fires. It also allows them the time to really delve into their subject, and if they put in the effort, can produce something they’re really proud of in the end. 

4. Having been on either side of these courses, it’s really nice for an instructor to send an E-Mail every now and then acknowledging the situation and providing updates. Another good strategy is to include a one-on-one zoom meeting as part of an assignment, and to use this meeting to check in with students individually. Sometimes it’s really difficult to seek help, and students just need a prof or TA to reach out on their own volition.

- Asynchronous lectures are way better. Just record and post them. There’s really no reason I can think of to require students to attend a zoom conference for part of their attendance grade. All it does is mess up people with poor wifi or who are in a different time zone. It’s totally fine to have synchronous lectures to try and preserve some human connection, but please don’t make them mandatory, it really hurts those of us who don’t have reliable connections. **Edit: People seem split on this. With many people saying they need the structure, which I totally get. If for no other reason than selfish ones, I’ve gotta stand by my opinion that I don’t think they should be mandatory. It punishes students for having poor connections.**

- Please don’t use remote proctoring. It’s invasive, clearly not secure, overly stressful, inconsistent (last year it randomly closed down my digital formula sheet which was allowed and completely screwed me on an exam). And it doesn’t even prevent cheating, it’s not that hard to tape a paper to your wall, or just have a friend who wrote the test earlier in the timeframe tell you what’s on it. Which brings me to

- Assignments/Takehomes > Tests. Honestly, as much as I despise remote proctoring and will never fully forgive queens for encouraging it, I understand why some profs felt it was necessary. It’s very easy to cheat in an online setting, but the solution isn’t to force students to install spyware on their computers, it’s to create assessments that have different rules. As an honest student who’s grades dropped significantly online, I hated hearing stories of students cheating so easily and coasting along with their 4.0 gpas. Giving take home assignments that allow for collaboration within groups and the use of notes etc evens the playing field, while at the same time eliminating the need for remote proctoring.

I’m gonna leave it here as I originally wrote it so the comments that reference it below still make sense, but with this acknowledgement that I’m in the minority in case someone only reads the main post.

If it's a subject that requires a lot of participation and discussion, a synchronous lecture is probably best. If it is a subject that is mostly just lecturing, asynchronous is probably better.

But please, if you're posting asynchronous lectures, be consistent about your timing. Either post them all ahead of time, or make them available to students at the same time each week (ideally before the scheduled lecture time). I had a class last year where the lectures were posted on random days some time throughout the week, and it made it really hard to plan my schedule. When everything is asynchronous, it is really hard to manage your time and it makes it even harder when the course content you need is inconsistent.

Have a great winter break everyone, stay safe :)",2021-12-17,False,0.96,ripzid,"If you're posting lectures, please post the transcript as well!! It's not too hard to get transcribing software going alongside your recording (Zoom will do this for you), and it makes taking notes on the lecture so much easier. Plus it makes it so much more accessible.

If possible I think prof should do synchronous lectures then post the recording. I am easily distracted so if a prof goes slow on a topic I'm comfortable with, even in person, I retain nothing. 2x the speed is godsent for those instances. But if I'm struggling with something, the opportunity to engage and ask questions is very helpful.

Super agree with not having only significant term papers but more lead-up papers. Profs should be comfier with splitting assignments into parts, where part 1 is worth less, but you're able to receive feedback and grow until you reach the final part (worth the most) and are comfortable with the skills you're being asked to portray.

Finally, I'm conflicted deeply about proctoring. Some courses are very application-based, particularly writing-based classes and non-medical sciences (i.e. ENGL, MATH, CHEM). I don't think those should be heavily proctored, and from what I've heard, they generally are not online. However, in some biomedical science courses, I believe it makes sense to force you to memorize dense content sometimes. For example, in micro-courses, there are many fundamental microbiology terms etc., that you must know to understand higher-level courses and content. And sure, not 100% of it will be retained, but a lot of the foundational stuff generally is. I think that exams (even if proctored) should tend towards applicatory style, but the ability to apply content in a closed-book setting is still more impressive. From my perspective, it means that you have amassed the knowledge, have it accessible to you, and that your perspectives are fully your own reflection of the content and not of an NCBI article.

I've edited that last point a lot... but I totally expect people to disagree. I hate studying + the process of writing proctored exams as much as the next person, but I do really see that it offers a unique form of evaluation.",2021-12-18,,11.0,False

It’s totally fine to have synchronous lectures to try and preserve some human connection, but please don’t make them mandatory, it really hurts those of us who don’t have reliable connections. **Edit: People seem split on this. With many people saying they need the structure, which I totally get. If for no other reason than selfish ones, I’ve gotta stand by my opinion that I don’t think they should be mandatory. It punishes students for having poor connections.**

- Please don’t use remote proctoring. It’s invasive, clearly not secure, overly stressful, inconsistent (last year it randomly closed down my digital formula sheet which was allowed and completely screwed me on an exam). And it doesn’t even prevent cheating, it’s not that hard to tape a paper to your wall, or just have a friend who wrote the test earlier in the timeframe tell you what’s on it. Which brings me to

- Assignments/Takehomes > Tests. Honestly, as much as I despise remote proctoring and will never fully forgive queens for encouraging it, I understand why some profs felt it was necessary. It’s very easy to cheat in an online setting, but the solution isn’t to force students to install spyware on their computers, it’s to create assessments that have different rules.

Not everyone tests/quizzes well, I do not, something discovered by a couple of my profs in first year. Quizzes dont show you did the readings, plus the purpose (at least in humanities) isn't to show you did the reading but that you can apply the reading and make your interpretations. The feedback from discussion posts can be used to help you formulate a better final paper as TAs will make notes of how to improve, which is feedback applicable to final papers.

Agree with synchronous lectures which are recorded so those who can't attend can still watch them, but asynchronous does not work at all for me as I will neglect to make it part of my life if its on my own schedule because life gets busy. 

One course I took, my issue was feedback for Discussion Post 1 came after the deadline for Discussion post 2. I understand TAs are busy, but the feedback should help us with the next assignment, but if we get the feedback after the due date then we can't use that feedback to enhance  the next post. And shocker, the points I missed in part 1, were missed in part 2. So quicker feedback or longer time in between assignments is helpful to provide better work.

- I fully agree with the person who asked that if the lectures are asynchronous, to post them at the same time each week. Last year I had a prof who posted lectures sporadically, and would post a lecture video that was for that week on Friday at 7pm. So I had to give up my weekend due to their poor planning (they had said they would post them Mondays and Wednesdays). 
- discussion posts are fine if you’re clear about what you want from them. Like, do you want us to include citations? How long should they be? Anything above 500 words is criminal though. 
- the absolute worst class I’ve taken was this year. The prof just had us read one chapter of the textbook a week with a total of 3 assignments interspersed (and a 50% exam). This was the second part to a two part course, and I absolutely adored the first part, but this made me hate the topic. There were no lectures — there were 2 minute videos that told us what we’d be reading about each week. 
- for more “technical” classes/pure science classes, I found asynchronous lecture videos to be the best since 1) I could pause and do the examples myself before seeing the answer 2) I could fast forward when I already understood the concept and 3) half my profs talk too fast and the others talk to slow so being able to control their speed was a god send 
- for me, at least, multiple small projects or multiple tests are so much better than one big essay or test at the end. This also keeps me accountable and engaged 
- for math, I liked that the tests I had for one class were not proctored and instead, to get full marks, you had to fully explain why and what you were doing. So like, naming and explaining each formula you were using and why it applied in that context. Even though it was tedious, it was a lot less anxiety inducing than proctoring and still made it really hard to cheat and do well

I definitely feel more motivated during synchronous sessions, async feels like I’m stuck watching YouTube and I get bored way more easily.

2. Oh my God yes! I remember reading some article where some guy was logging onto examity and the field for his name caused google to prompt filling in his credit card number while screen sharing. The same thing happened to me with a gift card I had saved. Giving someone full access to my computer as well and having them watching me the entire time is also pretty invasive. In a normal exam, you’d see the proctors going around the room but when it at least feels like all the attention is directly on you it also creates so much pressure. There are plenty of ways to adapt online exams and make them at least mostly cheat-proof without proctoring.

3. Also this! I feel like having time to absorb and understand the content makes me retain it a lot better than trying and failing to memorize it all and regurgitate it in a brief amount of time. If I cram for a test chances are I’m going to immediately forget that information once I’m done. Take homes and assignments give me more chances to go over the material with less pressure and actually take the time to apply and understand it.

4. I feel like these can be useful sometimes but they’re easy to forget how to do and finding things that others have not mentioned yet, replying to other peoples posts, not knowing how long or short they need to be, etc. can be a pain in the ass for sure.",2022-01-13,,1.0,False

The avoidance of contradiction by SCIENTISTS:Mathematicians DoubleThink

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink

Doublethink is a process of indoctrination whereby the subject is expected to simultaneously accept two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in contravention to one's own memories or sense of reality.

EXAMPLE

you know 0.9999... (the 9s dont stop) is a infinite decimal thus non-integer by notation

you know 1 is an integer

yet you also believe

you say

1=0.9999...

without contradiction

because now you say

0.999... is now an integer

here is the doublethink

1 integer = 0.9999... non-integer infinite decimal

ie

an integer is /=a non-integer

which is a contradiction in terms -which your doublethink does not see

thus

maths ends in contradiction

Well I was sitting here trying to think of odd things my housemates have done when I realized I’m the odd housemate.

- I often stay up all night, at one point in the semester I was completely nocturnal sleeping from 9am to 5pm

- I do card magic

- a few times I’ve walked into the living room and done a shot of tequila in the middle of a test… my housemates were quite confused when they asked me what the occasion was

- One time my housemate made a joke about how nobody ever puts the toilet paper on the holder properly, so I spent about twenty minutes boring a hole through it to stick it on [like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/MpeV6id54f9XUVmt7)

- I got high and walked around holding our barbel… just kinda picked it up and walked around with it, not lifting it or anything, just holding onto it. It was kinda awkward trying to fit through doors, can’t tell you what I was thinking

- I often eat entire sleeves of bagels in one sitting, I find them moreish



Some cool things my housemates do that I thought of while typing:

- One of them can solve a Rubik’s cube in like twenty seconds 

- They’re all really musical, we’ve got like seven instruments in the house (there’s six of us and I don’t play)

- One of them used to work at the keg and can make steak like an absolute chad

- One is always dipping out of the house to play sports, but it’s always a *different* sport. I have no idea where he finds all these one-and-done games

- Two of them are starting a podcast 

- And last but not least we’ve got the one that’s super into postmodernist political theories

I am a prospective international student looking to study in Canada. I guess my main question is whether I should go for college or university according to what I want to study and my situation which I will explain briefly. 

I’m interested in the media arts/media-related programs that tackles not only the typical media stuff like film, photography, media history/communications..etc. But preferably a combination with something more practical and I guess could serve as an exploration or back up that the media/arts degree lacks? 
For example, a combo with something tech or design, or business. And so far, I’ve seen programs that fit what I’m looking for all to a certain extent: 
- School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) from SFU
- Media Production and Design from Carleton 
- Computing and Creative Arts from Queens
- Global Business and Digital Arts from Waterloo
(Maybe some programs from York? Not sure haven’t looked deeply into them yet) 

I haven’t looked much into colleges as up until recently, I did not really understand the difference between a college and a university. But I see a lot of pros of going to college being you get practical skills in a shorter period of time (essentially saving a lot of money as well) and that ultimately leads to experience and is what you need to get a job essentially. BCIT for example seems to have a good reputation for this. Though the worrying bit is the less security of not having a degree.

And personally, I am definitely intrigued by the time saving and less costly idea of getting the same if not more hands on experience needed to go into “the real world” especially since I’m an international student who needs to pay a much larger sum for tuition fee, and one that is hoping to stay long term. But also BECAUSE i’m an international student, I guess I’m all the more lost on what I should do you know? To attempt to get the most favorable outcome.

A little about me though, the media thing, I don’t have experience yet, I’m very much just very interested in it (and believe me coming from someone who’s been trying to find one interest their whole life, it’s good enough) though I am looking to do some online courses to get a feel and hopefully some knowledge before continuing on with this pursuit. However, because I’m not exactly sure I’m passionate about this, I would love some options to be explored. And for that matter, I’ve heard a lot of good things about SIAT and Carleton’s Media and Production program being beginner friendly (?) and the other programs listed seem to do the trick.

So of course I need to take all that into consideration as well.

University teaches you more critical thinking skills. It teaches you more of how to think than what to do. Like every course you take in COCA may not relate exactly to the career you are interested in, but it will give you a vaster amount of knowledge that will allow you to be more Innovative.

And for that matter, I’ve heard a lot of good things about SIAT and Carleton’s Media and Production program being beginner friendly (?) and the other programs listed seem to do the trick.

So of course I need to take all that into consideration as well.

Thank you! 🥺🤗🙏",2021-12-16,False,0.6,rhirwl,"As someone who goes to Queen's who almost went to BCIT, I'll give you some of my thoughts. Going to a place like BCIT certainly has a much different social life if that matters to you, a place like BCIT has a social life more comparable to a high school than a university like Queen's. I'll be honest, the main reason why I chose university over college was because I wanted to party. You'll likely make less connections at a place like BCIT, but I would assume connections at a place like BCIT would we more applicable to work opportunities. I'm in Computing here at Queen's, I like it but it could definitely be better, it certainly doesn't feel like a world class program. One thing to consider about going into computing is that Math is unavoidable, you'll deal with calculus, algebra and discrete mathematics. Personally, I don't think you should be too worried about a degree but whether that is a worry to you is up to you. I'll add that my friend who is studying Media arts at Carleton hasn't complained about it at all, so I'd assume it must not be too hard. I'll also add that my brother who had gone to university at SFU for the social arts had gone to BCIT after already having a Bachelor's Degree and felt like it was too much to handle and dropped out after a couple months. All of my friends at BCIT right now seem to be happy with their sitatuions, for all that matters. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

If you don't care about a social life and you would like to get into the workforce quickly, going to somewhere like BCIT could certainly be a great idea, it's also my understanding that BCIT's reputation is very good and improving.

If you want to party, college is basically a non-starter. 

In terms of going to Waterloo and having a good career, as long as you graduate through Waterloo you should be able to get a great job basically anywhere in Canada after.

If you go into COCA at Queen's, you should certainly be able to find a good job in Canada with relative ease if you graduate.

If you go to university, you will very likely learn loads of information that will never pertain to a job you will have in the future, whereas, if you go to a college like BCIT, you're just being prepared with what you need to be a useful and good worker with no bullshit in between.

1928,"Just hoping to get multiple perspectives :,) I’d really appreciate it if anyone could read this 🥺",1,rhirwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/rhirwl/just_hoping_to_get_multiple_perspectives_id/,4,Discussion,"Hi, if you are on multiple Canada-related subreddits, you may see this post often and I apologize, but I guess I wanted to get as much perspectives as I could.

I am a prospective international student looking to study in Canada. I guess my main question is whether I should go for college or university according to what I want to study and my situation which I will explain briefly. 

I’m interested in the media arts/media-related programs that tackles not only the typical media stuff like film, photography, media history/communications..etc. But preferably a combination with something more practical and I guess could serve as an exploration or back up that the media/arts degree lacks? 
For example, a combo with something tech or design, or business. And so far, I’ve seen programs that fit what I’m looking for all to a certain extent: 
- School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) from SFU
- Media Production and Design from Carleton 
- Computing and Creative Arts from Queens
- Global Business and Digital Arts from Waterloo
(Maybe some programs from York? Not sure haven’t looked deeply into them yet) 

I haven’t looked much into colleges as up until recently, I did not really understand the difference between a college and a university. But I see a lot of pros of going to college being you get practical skills in a shorter period of time (essentially saving a lot of money as well) and that ultimately leads to experience and is what you need to get a job essentially. BCIT for example seems to have a good reputation for this. Though the worrying bit is the less security of not having a degree.

And personally, I am definitely intrigued by the time saving and less costly idea of getting the same if not more hands on experience needed to go into “the real world” especially since I’m an international student who needs to pay a much larger sum for tuition fee, and one that is hoping to stay long term. But also BECAUSE i’m an international student, I guess I’m all the more lost on what I should do you know? To attempt to get the most favorable outcome.

A little about me though, the media thing, I don’t have experience yet, I’m very much just very interested in it (and believe me coming from someone who’s been trying to find one interest their whole life, it’s good enough) though I am looking to do some online courses to get a feel and hopefully some knowledge before continuing on with this pursuit.

Econ student",2021-12-14,False,0.82,rgjyc6,"'08 applied economics alumnus here. Yes you use some of it, but stats ended up being the consistent math through it all. Am sure Lagrange multipliers have their place somewhere but I never really used it again. Except in more math classes.

Econ history is less math heavy. Was a 3rd year course and one of my favourites. I took a model of output developed to analyse impact of civil war on US, and applying it to a ""what if"" to Canada and WW2.

Stay out of applied economics if you want less math, though it opened up access to school of business classes. At least it used to, not sure if that is still the case.

Make use of your electives to explore random subjects. I took creative writing, intro to pharmacology, and religion at Queen's, and some Athabasca economics courses (made sure they were transferable first). 

I found Economics dull, tedious, and utterly lacking in any sort of real world representation. I think I read that there is now a behavioural science econ/psy department , which would be fascinating and worthwhile considering.

 If you wanted to you could absolutely bring them up on both criminal charges and I would believe you contacted the ra or your department head you could absolutely have them kicked out of university. 

This would be the same cause if say for example your roommates found out you were HIV positive and they were screaming ""kick the fagot out"" this is not your fault, I'm going to take a logical guess and say you're probably smart enough to not try to attend a covid party. 

Although I'm not a Queen's university student I do have family there and I do have some experience with harassment laws and such even if your dorm or building has security and you call them saying ""my roommates are harassing me at 3:00 a.m. I'm scared for my life"", they will still come over and they will absolutely detain them until police arrive.

But I think it's not enough.

I was notified that I am a close-contact personel so I need to get a test. The in-campus clinics noted are already fully booked (as far as I know don't cite me), so the next time I can get a test is not until next week--I don't have a car so I might need to hike 50 mins there if I don't have a ride. We need larger operations that are more accessible than the city provides.

They decide to cancel in-person classes but decide to carry on with in person exams anyway--whats the deal with that? I'm pretty sure they can take the hint that putting hundreds of people in an exam hall, breathing the same non-conditioned air, is not advisable seeing that Kingston is pushing triple digits in new COVID cases--but no, since day one they have been bullshitting this until no end.

This doesn't help exam anxiety either, students are at a point that they are willing to get sick to get the year done an over with. I don't care if its the cold, flu or fever, this mentality will only worsen overtime if whatever sickness begins to spread.

I understand why they were lenient in the past. COVID cases were low and the province was in the process of reopening: But here are the facts NOW.

https://www.kflaph.ca/en/healthy-living/status-of-cases-in-kfla.aspx

As of December 3, 3:00PM, KFL&A reported 104 new cases since it's last reporting, a large majority being those of the 18-29 age group. We are currently in risk level red; at this point, the city should be giving out stay-at-home orders immediatly. Kingston hasn't issued any new measures about that as of now.

https://www.queensu.ca/safereturn/covid-19-outbreak-declared-within-queens-varsity-sports-community

On December 8, Queens issued a public statement of an outbreak declared in the varsity community--they havn't issued an exact number of those contracted the virus but have suspended all varsity training.

https://www.queensu.ca/safereturn/health-safety/case-tracker

From Dec 6 - 12 (at the time of me writing this), the current COVID tracker states there have been 35 new cases recorded, a jump from 11 in November 29-December 5. Please check it out in your own time.

With the new rises in the Omnicron variant and projections issued by the province, it feels that me and my fellow students are in the epicenter of a time bomb and the university isn't doing enough to stop it. I'm sorry if I'm sounding too emotional; during this time we should be focusing on fact instead of speculation. But it feels like management is treating this situation is all smoke and mirrors and downplaying for what it truly is. They need to stop exams immediatly or postpone it to an online format immediatly. Not doing it now may lead to another fully online winter semester which profs and students are ill-prepared for. Christmas is on the way and I fear that if the university doesn't act quickly, a lot of people won't be going home.

If you feel that you are sick or in contact with someone with COVID-19, please dont go to your exam. 

If you feel unsafe going to exams, it is up to you but I'd advise you not to go either. Remember that it is just a grade and no one should experience going through the tiring process of a close contact. No matter if we are sick or not, we reserve the right for accommondations, especially during this uptrend in cases.

I can't speak for any other faculty but if you are engineering, contact Engineering.AAC@queensu.ca and ask for accommodation. After I asked them about it, they mentioned in an email that they are working to setup exam times in Winter 2022 so we won't be taking in August--thankfully.

I understand why they were lenient in the past. COVID cases were low and the province was in the process of reopening: But here are the facts NOW.

https://www.kflaph.ca/en/healthy-living/status-of-cases-in-kfla.aspx

As of December 3, 3:00PM, KFL&A reported 104 new cases since it's last reporting, a large majority being those of the 18-29 age group. We are currently in risk level red; at this point, the city should be giving out stay-at-home orders immediatly. Kingston hasn't issued any new measures about that as of now.

https://www.queensu.ca/safereturn/covid-19-outbreak-declared-within-queens-varsity-sports-community

On December 8, Queens issued a public statement of an outbreak declared in the varsity community--they havn't issued an exact number of those contracted the virus but have suspended all varsity training.

https://www.queensu.ca/safereturn/health-safety/case-tracker

From Dec 6 - 12 (at the time of me writing this), the current COVID tracker states there have been 35 new cases recorded, a jump from 11 in November 29-December 5. Please check it out in your own time.

With the new rises in the Omnicron variant and projections issued by the province, it feels that me and my fellow students are in the epicenter of a time bomb and the university isn't doing enough to stop it. I'm sorry if I'm sounding too emotional; during this time we should be focusing on fact instead of speculation. But it feels like management is treating this situation is all smoke and mirrors and downplaying for what it truly is. They need to stop exams immediatly or postpone it to an online format immediatly. Not doing it now may lead to another fully online winter semester which profs and students are ill-prepared for. Christmas is on the way and I fear that if the university doesn't act quickly, a lot of people won't be going home.

If you feel that you are sick or in contact with someone with COVID-19, please dont go to your exam. 

If you feel unsafe going to exams, it is up to you but I'd advise you not to go either. Remember that it is just a grade and no one should experience going through the tiring process of a close contact. No matter if we are sick or not, we reserve the right for accommondations, especially during this uptrend in cases.

I can't speak for any other faculty but if you are engineering, contact Engineering.AAC@queensu.ca and ask for accommodation. After I asked them about it, they mentioned in an email that they are working to setup exam times in Winter 2022 so we won't be taking in August--thankfully.

The true spread of Omicron throughout the province/country is currently unknown but if asked to speculate I would say it is everywhere or soon will be. A pre-print today showed that Omicron is 4.2 times as transmissible as Delta. We do not know how severe Omicron is. Pfizer's CEO recently spoke about how their current data suggests having three vaccinations gives the same protection for Omicron that two gives for original covid. 

As we learn more about Omicron's severity over the next 1-3 weeks I expect we will have a much better understanding of what this means for restrictions. 

My best guess is a delayed start in person, or moving to online. It really depends on Omicron's severity, and the province's roll out of booster shots.

Ultimately it's hard to say. I suspect the Ford Government will do ""whatever they can"" to prevent health districts from declaring a lockdown to help their election odds, but full on covid-denialism almost lost Jason Kenny his leadership position with the UCP.

In my second year of engineering, I couldn't be happier to be writing my exams in person and bringing some of that normalcy back to my life, and it's clear that those against writing in-person exams are only prioritizing their own already online schooling, and not taking others into consideration. 

Obviously, there are people who are actually scared about getting covid before returning home for the holidays, and to those people: Only try to push your ideology if you personally have not put yourself at a greater risk than those already present. I know too many people saying this is a good idea when not even a week ago were out at Trinity and house parties with not a hint of concern. 

The purpose of this message is not to downplay covid, it is definitely a concern for those going home to see those who are higher risk, the purpose is rather to oust those pushing this petition for their own personal gain, and not taking into consideration how it will affect those of us who are more than happy to write exams in person and attend in-person classes.

IMO Queen's shoulda invested more heavily in some remote proctoring service so that those who feel well enough can write in a lecture hall, and those who do not can write through a remotely proctored service. That way, no one can complain— those who say Examity is the devil have the option to write in person, and those who are worried about COVID can write remotely but still proctored.

My friend is trying to get into a Design Program, but his portfolio may not be strong enough. Is it possible for him to get in as undeclared year 1 and enter some sort of Arts at Queen's in Year 2? The whole creative arts and the undeclared thing are very confusing. Is Creative Arts a program?

Another question is he doesn't really like the paints, sculptures kinda stuff and he wants to study art on digital platforms. Is that offered at Queen or is there a way to somewhat dodge these acrylic paint, sculptures kind of courses and only pick a focus in digital media? If not, do you know any universities that have a more digital approach to art or design?

1.Speed through the mc. I took the course last year and I wasted so much time on MC as I did 1:30h *2 for both for the SA and the MC. The MC is only worth 33% of your mark so only spend an hour max on so you have 2 hours for the SA which is worth 66% of your grade. The midterm is hard but the final is basically the same and people generally do better as you get the gist of it. I think our final might have been positively bell curved lol.

2.Also attend the course crams if they are happening they go over the general stuff and provide notes.

3. Do the practice MC test and the textbooks MCs.

4. Do flashcards. Make your own or use premade ones on quizlet or convert them to anki with the extension (if you are lazy like me). You can search up how to use the extensions and the apps.

5. Make the learning outcomes into SA questions. This really helps you solidify the content. You can also make your own practice questions and attempt any of the questions your classmates post on onQ or use the practice SA questions provided by the course.

Best of luck the course is a killer as it is a weeder for PSYC majors. I got like a 50 or 60 something on the midterm and 75 on the final but somehow ended up with an A- thanks to the bonus research surveys. Feel free to ask me for anymore questions.",2021-12-05,,5.0,False

thanks!",2021-12-05,False,0.92,r9k0lq,"I'll give you my advice as a law student who did really well in undergrad. 

First off, don't stress. There is a huge mental component to writing exams. Stressing fucks with your frame of mind. Yes, everyone gets anxious, but rather than stressing, use that anxiety to challenge yourself. Studying sucks, but doing well on an exam is a great feeling, and is honestly pretty fun. Tune everyone else out, and just write the exam for yourself.

Heres my strategy -

1. Go through all your notes. Everything. Take your time and re-read the slides, your course notes, whatever you've got. It takes some brute force and its not fun, but you need to do it. For me, this alone was typically enough to get 90s in undergrad because most exams are pretty straightforward and you know can just regurgitate a lot and do quite well. 

2. If you have time, make yourself an outline. I never did this much in undergrad, but I do it in law school now, and I'll tell you, the process of structuring your notes will not only help you to remember concepts, but it will also help you make connections between concepts. 

3. Read past exams. Get a sense of the problems you might be asked. I rarely have time to go through them, but having an idea of what to expect will save you time on the exam. 

Finally, I'll just say this. Doing well in undergrad comes down to putting in the work. Most exams have a lot of freebie marks available like multiple choice and you should be able to crush those sections. Most people don't put the work in. If you do you will be rewarded.",2021-12-07,,1.0,False

Turn off your phone and put it under your chair as soon as you are seated.

Bring as few belongings as possible. Bags are not allowed in the room. Go to the bathroom and have what you need before you enter the room. You won't be able to drop your stuff and then leave to get your calculator. Ziploc bags are better than pencil cases for your pens/pencils/etc.

If I could list all the times she's been a pain, it would be longer than my capstone summary. I'll give a few examples from my 2-year rent I ended around a year ago.

1. She gave back me and my housemates security deposit 7 months (yes SEVEN MONTHS) after I moved out of the property. If we hadn't called her weekly on updates, I'm not so sure she would have even sent it to us. Some people I know have told me its illegal to take that long, but I haven't really looked into that very much. EDIT: I also wanted to add to this by saying she wanted to charge us for cleaning services right after we moved out, despite IMMACULATELY cleaning the house. We cleaned as hard as we could for 3 days because we didn't want her to take any of our security deposit as cleaning fee's. After all was done and we moved out, she wanted to charge us ***$800*** on cleaning fees which she thankfully waived off the bill as her apology as to why she took 7 months to return our security deposit. Y'all can call me a liar, dirty, or someone who is exaggerating but I swear on my life I don't how we could have cleaned the place better than we had. It seemed cleaner than when we first got to the place!!!!!
2. My housemate was subletting her room to a quiet, and friendly girl. A couple times a week, she would invite over her boyfriend which was fine with all of us. Daphne absolutely hated it, and made her sign a contract to limit the boyfriend visits to once a week because she thought he was loitering and living in the house with us. I am not kidding.
3. The state of the house is poor. Sure, we weren't paying expensive rent prices, but the quality of things like the shower head which would fall off (and we paid for despite it being shit quality), the heating of our floor which was very weak and only controllable by the thermostat on the floor below us by other tenants, teeeerrible heat insulation, paid coin laundry in the neighbours building, broken laundry machine/dryers, mice moving around in the walls and make noise at night, ROTTING CEILING PAINT which would chip away on top of our beds was just fucking awful. There's more but I'm not bothered to list it all.
4. Daphne has contacts with the neighbours to rat out anyone doing anything she doesn't like. No joke, every time we went in the alleyway behind our own house, and old lady would give us a death-stare and call daphne to tell her we were loitering on property that wasn't ours even though we were only passing by the alley for 10 seconds to more quickly get to school. If daphne catches you doing ANYTHING she doesn't like, she immediately calls her security guard to kick you out.
5. She would pride herself with how shit her property is. She quite literally prides herself in the fact that ""my property has not been renovated in 30 years"" or some other long timeframe. Absolutely bonkers she would say that, because its clear the house needs some renovating. The floorboard was so squeeky you could wake everyone up at night, and the overall quality of everything was so, so shit.
6. Every time her carpenter or cleaners would come in to fix/clean, she would tell us, the tenants, to not talk to them under any circumstance. Every time they tried to talk to us or each other, she would SHUSH them (which I find extremely weird and rude), and one of my housemates tried making small talk with one of them for a few minutes to which Daphne quickly disapproved and got mad at us for. So, so weird.
7. She also loves to sit in her car right in front of the front door for hours at a time to (let's be honest) stalk you and catch you doing anything she considers wrong. Super fucking annoying and makes me feel like I gotta watch how I live in my own room...

Honestly, I'm a pretty forgetful guy, so if you want some more awful details just let me know and I can ask my housemates who probably remember more than me. It was not a good experience renting from her during, or even after the rent was over. It was always a pain in the ass, and something was always breaking because of the overall low quality of the house which we always ended up paying for because of her evil contract despite us treating the place well. The rules she has in place makes  you think they are for your safety and well-being, but most of the time its just to get some money out of you if something breaks or have some reasons to kick you out of the property. There have been countless times when I actually questioned if what she was doing was illegal, which looking back I am sure they were at times.

Also, if you do decide to rent from her, know that subletting your room is very difficult with her because she hates it. She will perform detailed monthly cleanliness checks. She will also make you sit through a 3 hour session of her reading the entire contract to you one line at a time. Good luck.",2021-12-03,,12.0,False

My bf and his roommate were confused because a) they control utility payments, not her and b) when they asked how much a typical utility bill was, she said 200$ total— so why were they paying her so much more? They offered to each pay 200$ as a compromise but she essentially said it’s 500$ each or bust. They ended up voiding the lease within 24 hours of signing.

Its going to be a lot of work, but I think the work/life balance is pretty good. You definetly have a lot of time to do stuff with friends or be on design teams

Along with your required poli-sci courses and your electives at Queen's, you do a mandatory macro and micro economics course in your first year, and then statistics in your second. Having a macro and micro econ credit was a prerequisite for getting into my master's program, and everyone in that program needs to take a stats class before they graduate so because Queen's already made me take those courses as a part of their poli-sci program, I felt like I was well prepared to do them going into grad school while some people in my master's program are just learning stats for the first time. You say you're only doing a year abroad so econ and stats might not be as important to your decision, but there were a lot of really interesting poli-sci classes and the faculty was really knowledgeable and approachable. I was able to get two really great references for grad school from professors who taught me in my 3rd year. Queen's has a good academic reputation and also has good student life and lots of parties and events. I really enjoyed my time there living in the student district and going to house parties. Kingston also has lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance and some of them are really popular with students.

Kingston, Ontario (Queen's): Small city of around 125,000 people. Very tight-knit student community and a campus close to downtown; great student neighbourhood but very little in the way of nightlife & cultural events.

Hamilton, Ontario (McMaster): Medium-sized city of around 500,000 people. The student community there is a bit bigger and not as close, but they still have a great campus life. There's a lot more to do in the city of Hamilton though, and you can get to Toronto in about an hour on the transit system.

Vancouver (UBC): Much bigger school, and a bigger city of around 2.5 million. However, the school is out in the suburbs, and it'll take about 45 minutes on a bus to get into the city. As far as I'm aware the student community isn't as good, but there's a lot more going on just because of the size of the school.

2484,Transfer Into Queen’s Commerce,4,r7696x,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/r7696x/transfer_into_queens_commerce/,4,Question,"Hey all,

To start off, it’s always been my dream to go to Queen’s Commerce since grade 10 in high school. In my Gr.12 year, I applied for Queen’s Commerce and Ivey and ended up getting Waitlisted at QComm and eventually rejected, and flat-out rejected for Ivey AEO. 

Then, I decided I would take a gap year after graduating to try and take another chance at QComm and Ivey again. I studied online with ILC while working full-time jobs and upped my average from 90.5% to 92.7%. Yet, I got flat-out rejected once again from both QComm and Ivey. 

As a result, my best option was to go to Laurier for the BBA program as I couldn’t stomach taking a second gap year to reapply again… But, my desire to go to QComm in particular has not gone away. I’m aiming to get into the Finance and more particularly Investment Banking industry. 

Queen’s Commerce has a much better recruiting profile in comparison to Laurier and I believe it would be hugely beneficial to my career. 

Now, I am almost at the end of my first semester at Laurier and I should get a high 10 or low 11 GPA this term and plan to continue this streak next semester. For context a 10 converts to a 3.7 on the 4.0 scale and an 11 converts to a 3.9. 

On Queen’s website it states competitive transfer applicants to Commerce have a 3.7 GPA or better. I also have an executive role on a business club here and many leadership roles from high school. have various full-time work experiences from high school summers and during my gap year. 

Therefore, I am wondering if you think it would be a fair idea to attempt a transfer to Commerce after I finish this school year? I know it’s extremely competitive but I feel as though I have a good profile to be considered. 

Another option someone told me is that if I don’t complete my second semester I will have under enough credits to apply as a high school student again. But it’s very risky because it means that I would have to wait for a Queen’s decision which would come in May (after I have completed my second semester exams) which would invalidate my application as a “high schooler”. But, if I don’t get into Queens Commerce this time I would not only have wasted 3 years of my time and would be kicked out of Laurier because I wouldn’t write my final exams.

In conclusion, I’m trying to see what my options are. If i try the transfer route it is SIGNIFICANTLY harder yet if try the “high schooler” route it would be a MASSIVE gamble. Honestly, I don’t know if I should give up on the QComm dream and just focus doing well in Laurier BBA and apply to Ivey after second year. Thanks for any help you can provide.

I was wondering if Queens gives out conditional offers/early offers in December? And if so what marks they use? For context my grade 11 marks are (applied for computing):

computer science: 94
bio: 94
english: 90
functions: 97
physics: 96
chem: 100
gym (it’s M level): 95

grade 12 midterm (which I don’t think they’d use for offers in December if they give those out):

advanced functions: 93
computer science: 95

I managed to quit mid-semester and this is what I would recommend to you. Exams are stressful, and you probably do not want to have withdrawal symptoms mid exams. The additional stress would probably cause you to be worse off anyways. What I would recommend is to move down to a lower nicotine concentration (50mg/mL -> 15mg/mL). Try to only hit it when you are really craving it, and try not to hit it first thing in the morning. After exams is when you should try and quit. When you go home, go cold turkey. This way you do not have the stress of school on your shoulders, and can focus on quitting. I found the change of environment psychologically beneficial. The only way to quit is you really have to want to quit. I know this might sound dumb, but quitting nicotine is incredibly difficult and a daunting tasks.

Do you all have any interesting tidbits?,2021-11-28,False,0.84,r447mb,"I was a tour guide in Kingston for two years while I was in school, and I honestly thing the city shines more in the summer than it does in the winter. Sure, it probably won't compare to the likes of Ottawa or Toronto in size, or sheer amount of stuff to do, but the vibes in Kingston during the summer are awesome. Since most of the students are gone, the population is like 85% locals and 15% tourists. There's always something going on in Kingston in the summer, and since downtown is such a small area it's super easy to get anywhere you want to go  just by walking. Market Square holds a farmer's market and an antique market. There's free movies there once a week. There's live music in the park by City Hall almost every night. The restaurants in the area are always busy. The tours I lead would sometimes have upwards of 100 guests for one timeslot a night. One of my favourite memories of living in Kingston was watching the final Tragically Hip show in 2016, right before Gord Downey passed away. There were like 20000 people packed into Market Square that night.

I did tours for the same company in both Toronto and Kingston, and I can honestly say the Kingston ones are so much better because the city isn't as built up, and still retains a lot of its historical buildings. Telling ghost stories in the downtown core of Toronto vs Kingston is night and day. Kingston history is also a lot more interesting than Toronto's. It was a significant military hub in the 1800s, and was one of the four original cities in the running for the capital of Canada too, a list in which Ottawa wasn't even considered for until later. Kingston is also known for the high amount of prisons in the area, which I believe maxed out at 7 at one time. Of course the most famous is Kingston Penitentiary, which  opened back in the early 1800s, and didn't fully close until 2013. If you're looking for something to do (and it's open) I highly suggest going on a tour there, and then to the Canadian Prison museum across the street.

And since I still retain some of my tour guide knowledge, here are some interesting, and slightly spooky, facts about Kingston:

- McBurney Park at the end of Clergy Street is called Skeleton Park by the locals because it used to be an old cemetery. However, when it was converted to a park the city didn't remove any of the bodies, so many of them are still there. When the city built a pool in the park a few years ago, construction had to halt halfway through because it turned into an archaeological dig site.
- The city used to be home to a thriving graverobbing ring in late the 1800s, who would rob graves and sell the cadavers to medical students at Queen's
- The first sitting of Canadian Parliament took place at Kingston General Hospital
- The courthouse by Queen's also used to be a jail where hangings would take place. People would come to Kingston from out of town to see these hangings.
- Drowning was a super popular way to die in Kingston, back when the Causeway wasn't there and people had to cross to go to Fort Henry by boat. There was no proper morgue at the time, so they would just float the bodies in the harbour until someone came to claim them.
- City Hall was super expensive to build and wasn't used by local government until later. They originally rented it out to tenants, one of which was a medical laboratory on the large dome at the top of the building. A few years after the lab moved out, they found a human head in a jar.
- Fort Henry was never actually attacked at any point during its use, however a lot of people still died there, mostly due to really stupid reasons (cannonball to the head)
- Kingston nearly burned down in a fire in 1840. A warehouse down by the lake was illegally storing gunpowder and it caught flame. The resulting explosion shattered windows all throughout the downtown area.",2021-11-28,,29.0,False

1) the profs are very hit or miss, sometimes you get some phenomenal profs who love what they teach and are dedicated to making you love it too, and sometimes you get profs who we’re just kinda assigned the course and have no real idea what they’re talking about. 

2) the student community is pretty solid, I have a good friend group of about 6 guys in comp sci, and am aware of quite a few more. I personally don’t go out of my way too much to meet other people in comp sci, but just from occasionally popping into the discord server, it seems as though there’s quite a community here. 

3) I would say that 80% male is a very accurate assessment

4) in terms of math centric, it is definitely fairly math heavy, but it’s mostly math you likely haven’t seen or heard of before. It’s a lot more theoretical then practical, but you generally don’t need a calculator to do the math we do, it’s more along the lines of understanding the principles behind everything

Real answer: Decent. That’s a very unhelpful answer to a question that can’t realistically be answered directly. 
If you want to take a good compsci approach to it, *in your free time*, get an RPI/jetson nano/low power system, and create a small rust/python/C(++) etc.  application to search through this subreddit for the relevant classifier terms for the last 4 years, adding the comments to a metadata file. 

Then go and parse said data. 

It shows usage of web api’s, application efficiency and optimization, proper search routine, automated data analytics amongst other things. 

Then publish it as FOSS under the GPL v2 (not v2 plus or v3, that shits gross) 

(FOSS = Free and Open Source Software)

You’ll then (ideally) have created a tool that can report who got in based on what with what in what year, and plot that as upper and lower bounds.

You have a huge course load, and they are generally all challenging courses, however, I would say that Mech isn't as bad as Elec. I would argue that Eng Phys simply opens more doors once you graduate, as long as you know how to sell yourself. You have most of the skills that a mechanical engineer will get, but with a deeper understanding of a lot of the theoretical foundations. This makes it easier to get jobs in High tech industries like Fusion, Quantum stuff, space stuff, etc. Also, due to the advanced math, physics, and programming skills you will develop, career changes are also a lot easier. Eng Phys grads will often get hired by management consulting. It also makes for an easier pathway to grad school, if thats your cup of tea.

For example, from my eng phys grad year, people went in to fusion, cold atom physics, wind turbines, banking, management consutling, tech, aerospace, etc. My mechanical grad year was more traditional things like HVAC, oil and gas, engineering consulting, etc. So it really depends on what floats your boat.

I will say, however, when employers see Eng Phys on a resume, they often don't know what the hell that is. I would highly recommend joining a design team (even if you don't do eng phys, but especially if you do). This will get you hired once you graduate. Most employers value that kind of expierence very highly. This will also feed your need for building things that move.

Another bonus to doing eng phys is that its much easier to switch from eng phys to mech than the opposite. You can try eng phys for a year or so, and if it sucks, switch out. No shame in it. If you try to switch into eng phys, its insane. You have to take something like 9 courses a semester for a year, and its already a really hard program.",2021-11-25,,10.0,False

In terms of employability, you're better off knowing how to use FEA/CAD rather than symbolically solving integrals and differential equations.

In Eng Phys you'll be forced to learn a lot of very difficult topics (relativity, E&M, quantum mechanics, ) at the same time time.

Supp App Tips (just copy and pasted from an old comment of mine - geared toward business undergrads, but some stuff is still relevant)

I recommend showing rather than telling (don’t say you’re a team player, try to show that by talking about how you did __.)

You want to stand out, but you only have a limited number of words/characters. Start with a hook, end with something memorable but don’t waste your word limit on adding unnecessary words when you could add experiences. You can, however, write in a way that relays your personality but make sure there isn’t room for misinterpretation.

I tried to show I have a growth mindset by talking about how I did (a), reflected and then began doing (b or a+b). Or how (x) experience changed the way I think about (y). Be careful with this; make sure you talk about how you changed and not just how you messed up.

My main advice for supp apps:

•	⁠know what they’re looking for and highlight your most relevant experiences accordingly (briefly mention other experiences if possible - or write about them as a chain of events: (t) had (profound impact) and ultimately led to (p) and (v))
•	⁠start with bullet points - write everything you can remember about the experiences you’re highlighting (makes it easier to write the actual paragraphs later)
•	⁠focus on the content first, then add humour, etc. if there’s space (need a good hook and conclusion no matter what, though)
•	⁠have a theme for each question (make sure it flows from the hook to the conclusion)
•	⁠start early (I really wish I’d done this one)
•	⁠look it over multiple times. If you can, ask a teacher, counsellor, or parent to look it over as well.

Lastly, if you’re like me, you’re probably going to have a huge list of programs you want to apply to. The problem is that a lot of them are due around the same time. Now, if you’re able to submit some of your apps early, you might be fine. But if you end up submitting them around the same time, be prepared to prioritize and cut some.

--

Also recommend getting Grammarly - helps with supp apps, assignments, emails, etc.",2021-11-23,,1.0,False

I'd recommend a few things:

1) reframe what ""good university"" means. There are a limited number of years after graduation where the school you went to matters. After that, experience and professional achievements matter, so this isn't the end-all-be-all.

2) Look up ""good"" universities for your specific program. This may not be Queen's! Check employment outcomes, future salaries of graduates, fail rates. All of those should be accessible on university webpages, though it may take some digging around.

3) Consider universities located in the city where you want to work. Many companies to hiring fairs with local universities, have internships with local school, or do coops.

Once a connection is established, a client will hold-on for dear life to a connection.

If your device connects to an access point near the entrance, then move through the building, your device will fight like hell to retain its connection to the access point near the entrance.

This is desired behaviour by devices in most circumstances.

So here's a tip: once you settle somewhere in a building, turn off device wifi, sit for a few seconds, and turn it back on.

With phones and tablets, go into airplane mode for a few seconds, then exit airplane mode. Airplane mode resets all device radios. Its base assumption is, when you exit airplane mode, you'll be in a completely different context, so it re-initialises all radios from scratch.

Toggling airplane mode is the best wifi tip for phones and tablets.  For laptops, toggle wifi off and on with 5-10 seconds in-between is roughly equivalent.",2021-11-21,,1.0,False

Take my advice with a grain of salt because anecdotal evidence is never *completely* sound, but I had below average grades and got into law schools quite easily. 

TLDR; it doesn't get much easier, but you can quite easily get into fantastic law schools if you play your cards right

**The difficulty of ECON**
Econ sucks. I took it because it as a major because it was the only first-year course I was halfway interested in. A couple people from my floor also decided to major in ECON so I reluctantly declared it as a major. The courses are sometimes interesting. I really liked Ian Keay's history classes and Gregor Smith's 4th year macro, but unfortunately a lot of the classes are kinda dry and theoretical. 

Econ is really hard, especially if you struggle with math. The courses are of more-or-less equal difficulty, the math never really gets harder than 255 but it stays at that level for 3rd and 4th year. It's important to make friends with people who know what they're doing. Queen's econ is a team sport, and trying to do it alone is unnecessarily handicapping yourself. My advice (if you haven't already) is to join the Economics clubs (like QES, Case Conference, etc.). You'll find people who are a) social and fun to hang out with and b) usually academic. Having smart friends in econ is the only reason I was able to make it through. This also has a side-benefit of helping craft your resume which will be helpful for...

**Law School Applications**
I'm assuming you want to apply to schools in Ontario, but the principles here are consistent across all Canadian Law Schools. You need 5 components to apply. 
* GPA (I think the average among accepted applicants is somewhere around 3.6)
* LSAT (Anything about 160 should be good)
* Letter of reference (Usually one academic and one free choice. Make pals with your professors NOW so they remember you)
* Personal Statement (Self explanatory)
* Resume

I had a 3.3 culmulatively but I scored a 167 on my LSAT. So that offset my lower-than-average GPA. ECON majors usually have an easy time with the LSAT, it's very strucutured and challenges the same thinking skills that we cover in class. I'm not telling you to forget about your grades, **but focusing your effort on a superb LSAT may be a good use of time if you're getting B's**. For me, I knew I was never going to be an A/A+ student in Econ, so I put in enough effort to get B+'s/A-'s and focused the rest of my time on the LSAT.

The personal statement is also incredibly important, but don't worry about that too much yet. You're likely to not have experienced the things you're going to put on your resume and PS yet, so join some clubs and build up that experience. 

**Overall**
Don't worry too much. Focus on doing well, switch up some study techniques, go to office hours, see if you can make some pals who know what they're doing, and most importantly, enjoy your undergrad.

Schools like Western and Queen's only look at your Last 2 years, so hypothetically you could dog your first and second year and come out strong for 3rd and 4th.

xoxo a very distressed econ student",2021-11-13,False,0.99,qsu3p4,"In many ways, the deprecation of intuition and the emphasis on quants is jarring to many in university.

I'm guessing you're in economics because of some personal interest with how societies and businesses are organized and function.  You may have some personal intuition about this that's served you well, so far.

Then along comes all this math, all these abstract concepts, that seem to be getting in the way.  Moreover the quants seem to be overweighted relative to developing intuition.

This happens in many disciplines. I chose mechanical engineering because I had a passionate interest in aerodynamics.  Then along came second and third years, totally disabused me of the notion that fluid mechanics was an intuitive thing.

Turns out, aerodynamics IS an intuitive thing. But it's buttressed by quantitative analysis.  The same is true of economics: your intuitions is always valuable, but it really helps to be backed by math.

Consider this a transitory period where your knowledge is reinforced by the quantitative facets of the subject, which can be difficult to grasp.

Think about the university's perspective: Economics could be taught with a more philosophical, hand-wavy curriculum.  One reason it's not is, it's easier and fair to gauge a student's performance with math.  I'm not saying this is right, just saying that at some point in the history of economics education, math took over for some good reasons.

Fight your way through it. The math will serve your intuition well, in the end.

Some advice: beg, borrow, or steal your way into a license for [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/students/).  This is a great tool for getting insight into math.

For example: you come across a hairy mathematical expression.  Enter it in Mathematica and, in sub-second time, you can analyze it, factor it, simplify it, dimensionally analyze it, reduce it, plot it, and ditto for its limits, discontinuities, differentials, derivatives, and integrals.  The hairy math expression becomes something you can play with and ultimately, better understand.

It's 2021, there is no reason math should be scary.  Also, accept no substitutes here. MatLib, and the other tools schools pick on the basis of licensing cost, are poor substitutes for Mathematica when it comes to insight from brief exploration.",2021-11-13,,2.0,False

- MAIL: How does mail work? Is there a lobby where packages can be dropped off/picked up?

I lived in John Orr Tower from 2017-2019. So I have relatively recent experience, but can’t ’double check’.

My lease started Sept 1. I believe most leases in the building are on the same schedule. However, I think there are a few units that can be rented for six months. You need to apply for an apartment in Feb/Mar (for Sept) because it’s always full (or at least it was pre-pandemic). The deadlines are on the website.

It was relatively clean. They come and sweep/mop the hallways quite frequently. The insides of the units will vary I imagine, since it will depend on the previous tenant. I never had any issues. However, they replaced the flooring right before I came in. So I imagine they also cleaned and stuff after. Never had an issue with pests of any kind.

The exterior walls are all solid concrete. I lived right beside the laundry room, so occasionally I would hear stuff. But it was never a bother. Didn’t ever hear noise from other units.

There are standard mailboxes right at the front. If the package is too large they drop it off at a pharmacy which has a post office and is down by Portsmouth Olympic Harbour. Not too far, but if you don’t have a car it would definitely be a pain.

There are four or five machines of both washers and dryers. They replaced most of them with brand new ones the second year that I was there. It was decently busy, but always doable. Also, since I lived so close I could just check before bringing my laundry. There were only a handful of times in two years where I couldn’t get a washer right away.

There were four outlets in my bedroom. Four in the ‘living room’ as well. I think I had one or two of those ‘outlet blocks’ and everything was fine.

I was with Cogeco on their student plan. I even got a discount that was only supposed to last a year, then I called and they made it another year. Never had any issues with the Internet. I was able to stream Netflix, Crave, etc. in HD without issue. Never tried a gaming console on it, but I imagine it would be fine.

It was warm in the winter, no complaints there. I was above the boiler room, so I had heated floors. In the summer there isn’t any AC, so it can get pretty hot. I had my own little AC unit and it was cool in my bedroom, not too bad elsewhere. But again, I think that was affected by the fact that I was just above the boiler room, so the floors radiated heat. Maybe other units were better.

Happy to answer any and all questions you have. Overall, I thought it was a great student apartment, especially for a grad student. 

The one thing I will warn you about is the need to get parking if you have a car and always have it displayed. I had a sort of hybrid pass for West campus and the ARC. It was like a thick credit card that I could beep at the gate of the ARC, not a dangly one from the rear view mirror, which meant I needed to remember to put it on my dash every time I returned home. Whenever I forgot to put it on my dash, I would get a ticket. Literally whenever, they were ruthless. Also, there doesn’t seem to be any way to have guest parking, so guests will get a ticket. There are pay stations at Jean Royce Hall, maybe you can pay for parking there and it covers all West campus? Never tried that.",2021-11-10,,7.0,False

- LEASING: When does leasing season usually begin for this building (the more specific the date the better, or early/mid/late December)? When do you find out if you got a unit? (If anyone who began renting specifically May 1st could shed some more light, that would be even more appreciated!)

- CLEANLINESS: How clean is the building itself? The units' bathrooms? Are there/have there been any pest problems (roaches, bedbugs)?

- NOISE LEVEL: Is the building usually quiet/normal noise level? Can you hear people talking/watching shows in their unit through the walls, or are the walls thick?

- MAIL: How does mail work? Is there a lobby where packages can be dropped off/picked up? 

- LAUNDRY: How many machines are there/are they usually busy due to the number of people in the building? How much do the machines cost? Are they the small residence-sized machines or regular sized laundromat machines? Do they use coin or card?

Cleanliness - It's an apartment building and student housing.  Orr houses all sorts of folks, so while I wouldn't say it's dirty, the common areas were not super clean.  

Mail - There's a mail room in the front. It gets kind of trashy with all the junk mail that gets delivered.

Noise - It isn't exactly quiet.  I would always do my work on main campus.  It's a densely packed filing cabinet for people.  Honestly though the most annoying thing was a loose piece of siding that slapped our valve by when it was windy, which was frequently when you're on the 9th floor next to a lake in Canada.  It never got fixed.

Laundry - Plenty of machines which run on those prepaid cards.  It was always a chore to bring a basket up and down to/from the 9th floor.

Heating and Cooling - I remember it getting hot as shit.  Especially in the warmer months.  People had bought their own AC units, which I never did.  Almost wish I had, but I was only there for a year.  I'm sure you could get one cheap from someone moving out if you knew to ask.

Internet - We had Cogeco.  It wasn't great, simply because of the network density in the building.  I remember being pissed it wasn't included in student housing, but I'm from the US so maybe it's a minor cultural difference?  

I think it was fine.  Not great, not terrible.  It was the least shitty alternative when I got my grant money to attend Queen's, which I didn't find out I was getting until April.  When we drove up to look at places, it was John Orr or an overpriced basement apartment.  We went with the views of the lake, which were stunning to be honest.",2021-11-10,,3.0,False

My four friends and I are looking for another roommate for our 6-bedroom house next year. The rent will be around 710 + utilities. It's across Victoria Park, a roughly 10-minute walk to University and Union (Stauffer). The house was just newly renovated this past summer and it is not in the student ghetto, meaning it is in a nicer neighbourhood and still close enough to the parties. 

A little more information about us: we are all in first-year Arts, three of us are girls and two guys, so we are looking for another guy preferably to balance the ratio (but it's not that important). Bonus points if you have a car ;).

PM me if you are interested and I can answer all other questions! The house is super nice, PM me and I'll send you pictures if you're interested.",2021-11-08,False,1.0,qpnx9e,Hey there!,2021-11-08,,1.0,False

2. Most leases in Kingston are 12 month (you pay for it even when you are not at school). You can find 8 month leases but they are few and far between. You can sublet in the summer to reduce your costs.
3. Closest to the university is the most expensive and IMO not that well maintained.

Right now I’m considering a transfer from Carleton U, as a CS student I wanted to experience more of university life than just staring at a screen, and my school just all but confined that most if not all CS courses for undergrads are going to be online.

I wanted to ask, is it any better here? I just want a chance to feel like a normal student, right now I feel more isolated then ever.

Thanks in advance!",2021-11-05,False,0.75,qnh2zo,"In terms of professor, Dr. Prouse is fantastic! She taught a GPHY 370 last year and was really looking out for everyone. The workload was decent and manageable. Since then, she's done a couple guest lectures for my classes and remains phenomenal! She is incredibly knowledgeable and explores so many unique sides to arguments and topics that you can have tons informed debates. 

Dr. Gordon's lectures can be dry at times, but the content is interesting. He likes trivia style questions and offers rewards (or has in the past) for perfect scores, like a $5-10 Starbucks card. There could be little homework beyond the assigned readings, but this is where he gets his questions from.

Both courses look interesting, Dr. Prouse would put an interesting spin on 229, but the exam is typically long. This is the first year 230 has offered as an intro to his 300-level course; exams are written in one class. If you want to pursue urban planning in Canada, I recommend 230. If you are looking for fields to explore, I recommend 229 (which also let's you into Cameron's Geographic Imagination course - definitely worth taking).",2021-11-06,,2.0,False

What did you do to solve these???",2021-11-05,False,0.95,qnei2t,"I graduated a little while ago now, but this is something most of my university friends and I struggled with coming out of school.

I wanted to be an automotive mechanical engineer coming out of school, and did just that for three or four years, before I realized that I was miserable and something needed to change. During my time as an engineer I had the opportunity to build software, and realized that I was kind of good at it, and I liked being able to make an impact  by analyzing data. I quit my job and switched into development, and haven't looked back.

I guess my advice (for what it's worth) is: 
1) try stuff out sooner rather than later if you can, to see if it fits. The idea of a field might be more interesting than working that field day-in-day-out for ten years.
2) do something you're good at. You're going to enjoy your job a lot more if you've got an aptitude for it.
3) be brave enough to quit and try something new if it's not a good fit (and assuming you have that privilege). I have a lot of friends that stayed too long at jobs that didn't appreciate them because they were too scared to make the move. As a bonus, switching jobs every few years is the fastest way to grow your salary.
4) keep learning new things. Investing in your own skills is the best way to grow your career and refine that idea of what you want.",2021-11-05,,1.0,False

What did you do to solve these???",2021-11-05,False,0.95,qnei2t,"Knowing what you want is a gift. Trust me, I'm ""old"", and part of the reason I'm in graduate school is because I don't *really* know what I want. Grad school will hopefully take me into what I *think* I want but there's no guarantee I'll like it or even land a position.

In my experience, people who truly know what they want to do with their lives when they're in their 20s are few and far between. If you hear about people jumping into something with gusto, chances are there are external pressures (finances, family, culture, etc). These are the types that go through existential crises later in life and go from being a surgeon to a sculptor, or simply become unhappy surgeons.

My own personal motto (nobody asked but idk it might help someone) is to just do what feels right, to go with the flow, and to *develop* a passion instead of *finding* one. Do a little of a lot of things, try, fail, succeed, fail, try again, and see what sticks. Ditch your timelines (having to figure everything out by X age), ditch your expectations, and you'll find that you've never felt so zen about life.

OP, your questions were pretty simple and straightforward and I don't feel like I really answered them. But I've been there.

My advice if you find yourself in situation #1 is just try a lot of things. Start with a vague idea with where you could see yourself. However, it's hard to make judgement of whether you would truly be happy in  a career unless you meet people doing things and get a chance to try it yourself (and sometimes even going through the process of screwing it up once). Internship experiences in engineering helped me a lot in this regard. By the end of third year it was hard to tell how I'd be using all this electrical engineering knowledge. Doing a co-op year brought me much closer to working with engineers as well as a myriad of other staff at the workplace. It also helped me identify things I enjoyed **and didn't enjoy** doing, things I was good at, horrible at, and things that I'd want to get better at before I graduate.

Not in the biggest rush, but I am just curious.",2021-11-03,False,1.0,qljp6t,"It's been a hot minute since I've worked the front desk, but from what I recall it depends a lot on location and timing! Most of the folks who fetch the books go home for the day between 4:30pm and 5pm, so if you request books then, you'll have to wait for the next day to potentially get them, and that's if they're Queen's books! 

We send books between libraries through campus mail, and the crates are brought to the libraries once a day, usually early afternoon/lunch time! So if you request in the morning from Education for example, and for the book to be picked up at Stauffer, you may get an email saying it's arrived the same day :) If it's in the evening slash late night, nobody will see it until start time tomorrow! And that's IF it's a book in a Queen's library that is on the shelf, that you've requested from one library to be picked up at another.

If it's a book someone has out, and you've placed a hold on it, I believe how it works is the person with the book out gets an e-mail saying the loan date has gone from 120 days to 2 weeks, and they HAVE to return it and cannot renew it. Once they return it, we'll sign it in and the system says hey, this patron has it on hold! And it goes on the hold shelf and you get emailed! For that case scenario, it depends on how prompt the person who has it out returns it.

Then there's the Fulfillment Network! Omni is used between thirteen or fourteen universities, and we got to activate book loans across this network this past September! If your search on omni was for Queen's and Omni libraries, it'll search across all 13ish unis and if Queen's doesn't have a book, but say, Waterloo does, it'll pull it up and say ""not available locally"" but will list the other unis that have it! Then they get the request and it all depends on how promptly they handle AFN requests, and how fast postage is. 

So there's lots of answers for that question, but I guess the tldr would be anywhere from a day or two to a week or so, depending on how you reserved the book (on the shelf at Queen's vs out on loan or coming in from another library). It's always good to keep in mind that the fine folks at the library are very much human, and other things do crop up and they do have to go home and rest as well, so book holds may not arrive ASAP after submitting a request! :)

Curious.,2021-11-02,False,0.5,qlbqua,"So Queen's doesn't have the two semester school, one semester work placement program that Waterloo is famous for, instead we have the Internship Program, or QUIP. QUIP is either a 12-month or 16-month work placement, usually taken between a student's third and fourth year, ie you take a year off from school to work. It's most popular among Comp Sci/Comp Eng students, and 80% of the internships offered will be related to one of these two programs. QUIP is generally pretty helpful, if you sign up for it you'll have to do a resume writing workshop and maybe an interview workshop? I don't remember. They want you to get a job, it makes the school look good. Out of a couple dozen friends that went on internship, I only know one guy who didn't get a job through QUIP, though he still took the year off and managed to get a job on his field.

I did QUIP, and I still work for the company that I interned at. What's nice about an internship is the length. Working for a full 16 months gives you the time to really integrate with the company you work at, and will allow you to work on more difficult and longer projects than a four month work placement.

As for summer jobs, I personally don't know many who got them, but that doesn't mean they don't happen. One friend got his through nepotism, so connections are important.

In Bio. Possibly a healthcare program after. Looking for a program with some flexibility and not looking for the hardest
Most constraining program. What are thoughts on advantages/disadvantages among the above?",2021-11-02,False,0.75,qkvowr,"Hey I'm a 4th year biology major

Health Sci- hardest to get into, but from what I've heard it's the easiest to get good marks once you are in. I've taken a health course as an elective and it was the easiest class I've ever taken. Only con I can think of is if you change your mind and don't want to go into health the program seems so specific I feel like it would be trickier to go another direction.

Life sci has a direct entry option now, but if you are torn then you could do a general first year and then declare either life sci or bio at the end of the year(only risk to this plan is if you don't get good enough grades in first year you might not get into life sci for second).

Life sci and bio are very similar in first year, but after that they do become very different programs. Maybe if you google the course requirements and descriptions for upper years you could get a better idea of what interests you? Basically my understanding is life sci really focuses on human biology/physiology/biochemistry while biology you end up learning more about genetics(in general not focused on human), ecology, evolution-overall focused on all of life(plants, animals, bacteria, fungi- you even take a course called ""diversity of life"") and lab skills. Human examples come up, but definitely aren't the main focus. Also in upper years there are more options so you can take what interests you most, when I've heard life sci has less options.

Not sure if it would be of interest to you, but one thing I love about this program is the opportunity to do an honours thesis in your last year. Basically instead of taking 4 courses, I am doing research with a professor. This feels like it takes all you've learnt in your first 3 years, and now you really get to apply it. Plus it's such a great opportunity to get to work one on one with a professor and really prepares you if you go into research. The life sci program also does honours thesis programs(I believe focused on researching human disease?) But I'm not sure if health sci does.",2021-11-02,,2.0,False

One of my midterms went really bad (not got the results back but im dead sure i failed). The midterm is weighted at 35% and im pretty worried its gonna ruin my grade in this course and my GPA.

The exam got over on friday and the entire weekend all i've been thinking about is whether or not to drop the course and re-take it later.

I am a Year 11 IB student who’s just recently discovered Queens university and it has been well among my top list of universities so far. :)

I was wondering a few things.

1. For the commerce program here, could I do a minor while majoring in commerce? I’ve just heard some mixed replies for some reason so I hope someone could clarify on that :)

2. Do ECs matter for admissions to Queens or the commerce program specifically? It’s just it seems like a few unis like UOFT and McGill doesn’t really care about ECs? Just wondering how Queens are about ECs. I don’t have much.. actually barely 😓 So if it matters to a certain extent, I’ll try to build up more ECs.

3. Is it true that one does not need prior business knowledge to join/potentially do well in the commerce program here? Or is it a huge disadvantage?

4. If I ever get accepted, I will be going as an international student so if there is any international student or those who know some, it would be really nice and helpful if you could share your experience in the commerce program, internships, and student life at Queens in general i guess 😅

They moved around first-year requirements to allow for scheduling of minors. 

2) EC's matter more than your marks if you can get above an 87-88%, otherwise you'll honestly just get passed over. In my experience, I found that once you're above that number (not the 80% Queens says you need), but the 87-88%, it just boils down to your answers on the SE. If you think EC's would be applicable to your essay, then by all means, work extra hard, but if you have work experience, or have other relevant things to discuss, you will do fine on the essay.

3) I thought the same, which was everyone would have a deep business knowledge. That is not the case. A lot of students enjoy the idea of business, but don't really have any future plans. Having experience obviously helps, but not a must. If you're talking about courses in business, accounting and economics would be helpful, but not necessary prerequisites (as another comment said, we covered most of the past materials in the first 2-3 weeks).

Ask to make an appointment with a therapist. When you have the appointment tell them how you're doing and say you need regular ongoing treatment. They can usually work something out. Be aware that the appointments will be far apart (usually 2-3 weeks), but it's better than nothing. 

Then, once you've booked that, see about booking an appointment with a psychiatrist. Sometimes they want you to see a therapist first but I've also had success just booking straight away. They can diagnose you officially which will help with getting academic aid and they can give you prescription meds for depression, depending on your situation. Everyone's different of course. 

You can get accommodations for your assignments for extensions, alternate due dates, notes taken for you and so on through accommodations, but you'll usually need a psychiatrist note or documentation to get it. Try the therapy/psychiatry route first. Message all your professors beforehand if you need an extension and let them know what's going on. 

Then you're gonna want a few things to improve your general quality of life. 

If you can manage it, an exercise routine will help a LOT. Be it walking, running or hitting the gym a couple days a week, whatever it is, getting your body in good physical condition gives you the best chance to beat this thing. It'll help with low energy, appetite, stamina etc. Don't force yourself to go, try to go when you're already on campus and build a routine. Start with one or two days a week for three weeks then try three days. If you can manage that, and like it, add from there. 

You need an active hobby (try joining an AMS club that suits your interests), it will give you something to look forward to in the week and a place to make friends. 

Lastly make sure you're eating. Avoid sugars and fatty foods if you can. Meat, salads/vegetables and fruits, healthy snacks like trail mix. Rice, beans, eggs, stir fry's are all good if on a budget. Avoid soda.

Others have already given you great advice here. I am just adding to it. Suffered from anxiety many years back and did a lot of things that helped me. 

a)  If you can afford it, try some supplements with Tryptophan and 5HTP .(see research below) Alternatively, eat foods high in Tryptophan. It helps with anxiety, panic attacks and even depression.

[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/tryptophan](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/tryptophan)

b) Try to get good sleep. A great 7-8 hour sleep has a significant impact on your morning moods and serotonin levels. I highly highly recommend trying Super Sleep from Webber Natural for a month and seeing how you feel. It has melatonin and 5HTP.

b)  Activity triumphs anxiety and depression. Brisk walking, Jogging, running or even cleaning up reduces the awareness of anxiety. 

c) Finally, try to learn breathing exercises using Buddhist meditation techniques.

I am currently in third- year of Math major in Queen's. However, I am more interested in physics and engineering. My plan is to apply for a Master's degree of Engineering Physics, and I want to get into some decent engineering and science major universities such as McMaster or Waterloo. 

I tried to look online for some information of math student applying engineering graduate program, but the information they posted is unclear and confusing. 

I have been informed that in order to get a good university's master's degree offer, my GPA is the most significant. However, I took a lot engineering related math courses such as Math 326 and 334, and to be honest, I can barely even pass them. On one hand, if I take relatively easy math class, I may not learn much about physics and engineering in my undergraduate. On the other hand, if I take some engineering math class, I will definitely not gonna get a really good GPA. It seems unlikely for me to get 80% or higher for my undergraduate.

What reasonable choices do I have now? Do you guys know more information about my question? What level of university is plausible for me to pick? Please share your opinions with me!",2021-10-30,False,0.72,qiqec9,"You can see the requirements for a graduate degree admission on any of the university's websites.

That's for McMaster. Seems that for a lot of different engineering graduate degrees you'd qualify with or without your engineering undergraduate courses.

Speaking as a graduate student myself, focus on your marks, but what will really get you in is if you have solid academic references and a professor at the university you want to go to who will take you on (if you're planning on doing research). Make sure the professors in your current classes, especially the ones you are doing well in, know who you are. Getting references was by far the hardest part for me to get into a Queen's MSc program.

If you've got a shitty GPA but a professor really wants you in their lab, they'll make exceptions. A buddy of mine had a 2.8 GPA or thereabouts but essentially got a ""carte-blanche"" for attending a U of T MSc program because of a paper he wrote in his undergrad with a specific professor (who would also be his supervisor if he ever applies).",2021-10-30,,1.0,False

Unless the courses offered happen to fit with your major, it’s likely they will only be electives for you. But the learning environment is great - small classes, experiential learning, so if the subjects interest you, they were some of my favourite classes. And doing summer courses means you can take less courses during the year which is also nice. 
For me, it gave me the opportunity to go on an exchange without missing out on core courses for my degree, didn’t have to find someone to sublet my room, etc. But if you want to really immerse yourself in another culture, the BISC is not the same, you will be surrounded by other Queen’s students in the English countryside. It’s a lot of fun but not the same as being on your own in another country.

Here are my tips:

1. The posted recorded lectures are amazing (if they're still the Allingham ones), and better than Dr. Chan's (not sure if he's teaching). What I would do is first work through the module then watch those to reinforce the content.
2. Work with friends in the class and explain the concepts to each other as you do PBAs and modules. It really helps to explain what's happening because the course relies a lot on a holistic understanding of the content.
3. If the module quizzes are still a thing, take those seriously and review your module notes before you do them. Even though they're not worth much, being on top of the content by taking the quizzes seriously will help you come exam time!
4. 100% do past exams and discuss with peers in the class what the right answers are (since there's no answer key). Make sure you fully understand why the right answer is right, and why the wrong answers are wrong. A lot of the exam questions are similar to past exams in terms of the logic required to answer.

It starts in May, and goes for 4 consecutive semesters, so you would start in May 2022, and finish in August 2023. It includes 21 weeks of practicum placements, and you graduate with a specialty, which you either choose when you apply or take a concentration by combining a Focus Course, an Educational Studies course, and the Alternative Practicum.

You can apply to the Primary-Junior (kindergarten through grade 6), or Intermediate-Senior (grades 7 to 12).

Apply through this site: [https://www.ouac.on.ca/teas/](https://www.ouac.on.ca/teas/)

And here's a guide for doing that: [https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/teas-queens/](https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/teas-queens/) 

Application deadline is December 1st.

After applying, you have to submit a Personal Statement of Experience. That becomes available through [SOLUS](https://my.queensu.ca) after November 1st, and they have to receive that, along with your official transcripts and any supplemental documents, by December 10th.

On the next round of midterms, I did a bit better, but still thought that my first semester was going poorly in contrast to how I did in grade 12. It was very hard, but I had to put those midterms behind me and just keep moving forward step by step. But at the end of the semester, and eventually the end of first year, it turned out that I had generally done alright, passed my courses, and kinda worked out what my study tactics should be.

3rd year electrical engineering student. No matter what, don’t give up. Eng is tough, for four years you’re going to get pushed, which I’m sure you were aware of when you signed up. The great thing is everyone is in the same boat. Reach out to your peers and form study groups, work together to overcome it. EngLinks offers peer tutoring for very low prices (I think it’s 15 an hour), and go see an academic advisor. I would talk to someone about going into the BounceBack Program.

Buddy-up.

Find good people to share the journey. Some of that comes naturally with group work that'll be more common starting next year, but still applicable in first year.

Seek out motivated people who share classes with you, and flat-out say, can I study with you?  Be prepared to level-up.  Always give as much (or more) as what you get.  When you study with people, you're also hanging out. Ask for specific help, just as you would hope others would ask you for help with things you're good with.

Alone you're awash and vulnerable. In a motivated group, you're unstoppable.

In the end, peer support is absolutely vital to a quarter, or more, of your graduating class, four years from now.

“A prof of an upper year course can authorize the corequisite or prerequisite waiver if you contact them. E.g if you wanted to take MATH 221, Advanced Calculus, but hadn’t taken the calendar prerequisite MATH 121, you could ask the 221 prof for permission to join the class.
How you get enrolled on SOLUS after that differs by department, but usually the department hosting the course would manually add you.

Sequence:

•	⁠Email the prof of the course you want to take, explaining the situation and what SOLUS lecture sections, tutorial sections you would like if approved. I.e. enough information to add the course to your timetable.

•	⁠If the prof says ‘yes’, forward the email to the Undergraduate Chair in the same department with an explanation and your student ID, and say that you’d like to be added to the selection course and section(s).  They should be able to make the changes on SOLUS for you.

The two people murdered were not students and their deaths are not linked to homecoming at all, they simply happened to be at hoco the same day they got killed. Therefore queen's wasn't plagued by ""drunken violence"". These parties happen every year and sure a few people hurt themselves, but do not relate gang violence to hoco. And the double cohort effect thing is BS, homecoming is a big day for all students not just first years.. 

Now I get that people are pissed for students partying during a pandemic, but almost all of the student body is vaccinated, and the same kinda outdoor air parties  have been happening in cities (MTL, Toronto) all summer with no outcry nor violence. The police and media making this day such a big deal and trying to punish students and getting more involved than usual/past years is what caused it to get out of a hand, and the media keeps trying to push false narratives like writing BS articles with lies and stretching the truth

Obviously there will be a bit of bias but I am looking at doing a BComm and am trying to decide between Queens Commerce and Desautels at McGill. What are the pros/cons of the two programs  and why did you choose Queens over anything else? Also the party life is important to me. I am from a relatively small town in southern ontario and i’m not sure what the big city life is like. I want to make a bunch of new friends and i’m not sure if Montreal and McGill being right downtown would impair me from making student friends and meeting likeminded people. Im also not sure whether bars clubs and festivals are better than house parties and things like hoco.

I expect to have a 94-95% top 6 average by second semester mid-terms. I was just wondering if this would be sufficient in getting an acceptance? ECs/awards include First Robotics member in Grade 9, highest overall average in grade 9, highest manufacturing technologies mark in grade 10, self-taught Python through CodeAcademy over quarantine, volunteered at Best Buddies council, and worked at a landscaping company making invoices. I know my ECs/awards are pretty weak, but that is mostly due to Covid (could not do any school-related ECs during the second half of grade 10 and all of grade 11). I probably should have joined something for Grade 12, but I just wanted to focus on getting a good average so I decided to not do any clubs this year.

Note: I currently have a 90% average for my first semester mid-terms. Will this affect my chance of getting in, or will Queens Computing faculty look at my marks after I complete first semester and second semester mid-terms? In other words, if I don't get accepted during a certain admission round, will Queens still consider me for later admission rounds (once I get more marks)? Or will the reject me if I don't make the first admission round? Also, how many/when are the admission rounds?

I am a graduate student here and I absolutely condemn the actions of those students on homecoming, but did Queen’s really expect 18 year olds to make responsible choices? 

Queen’s pushed to allow for in-person classes this year, meaning that many students had to find accomodations in Kingston. It’s easy to say that these actions are irresponsible (they are), but these people are teens, many of whom have not had any experience at university with in-person classes. It’s ridiculous to expect teens not to go out. Queen’s had to have known this, but pushed for in-person classes because they would have otherwise lost a lot of money.

The KPD response was bad, I think the presence of assault weapons by some of the members and the increased militarization of the force is very scary. I do not think that the response was malicious, but I think it sends the wrong message. 

Queen’s should do much more to penalize students for this behaviour, and find ways to disincentivize gatherings. It’s a place of knowledge, and it has shown little in the way of mitigating covid isolation with student life.

Biggest thing is to attain the certificates needed along with your degree and usually specialize in terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems and go from there. Aquatic - electro fishing, minnow/fish ID, boating/canoe operations, SVOP, swift water training etc. Terrestrial - firearms license, atv/UTV operation card, plant and vegetation ID etc. 

There's a number of summer positions if you are under 30 in Canada as well. Check the government websites while getting your degree and gain experience over the summer. FSWEP and young Canada works. Those are great for building up the resume and some will cover the costs of the certificates above. 

Best of luck with the career for your son. I loved getting my degree and enjoyed every moment since. Biology is a varied field and can provide your son with amazing experiences - it has given me the chance to see the arctic, and almost every province in Canada. I also know others who went medical and lab routes and they have enjoyed themselves as well.

My advice would be to have your son google biology jobs by territory.    My quick search found 4 bio-related openings in Yellowknife, 3 in Nunavut.  Take the stated requirements for education, experience, and specific discipline with a huge grain of salt.  If your son appears even remotely capable, and is enthusiastic about science and living in the north he will likely pull an interview.  Its a good way to gain experience and get a leg up on a career.  Its also a terrific place to live if you like the outdoors!  Best of luck.",2021-10-18,,1.0,False

This year, students are randomly generated 3 questions, and must pick 2 to submit. Once you access the questions in SOLUS (the Queen's portal you will receive login info for after you apply on OUAC), students have 30 days to submit their essays for 2/3 of those questions. If they are not submitted by the 30 day mark, the questions are randomly refreshed. This means you and your friends will have different essay questions. The last day to submit the essays is Feb 15.
